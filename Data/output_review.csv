0,B000A6PPOK,Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000,5.0,"1,113",True,"10 18, 2005",AILCWT1IIP7ZT,{'Style:': ' Retail'},Charles Chen,"As a software developer, I am literally attached to my keyboard.  On a typical day, I'll spend anywhere between 5-8 hours typing, so it's of critical importance that the keyboard I use is comfortable.  As most programmers and typists can attest, the Microsoft Ergo series of keyboards is the best keyboard for prolonged use.

Having used the Ergo keyboards in some form or another for the past 4 years (most recently, the Wireless Elite set), I must say that this keyboard is a step above.

To begin with, the construction is very solid.  There is far less flex in the plastic and the keyboard as a whole compared to my Wireless Elite.  The wrist pad is made of a nicely textured faux leather material with a tiny bit of padding.  It feels rather durable (not to mention comfortable).  It's a good addition as one of my main gripes with the MS ergo keyboards was that it was hard to fit one of those gel wrist rests around the curved base of the keyboard.

Compared to previous MS keyboards that I've owned, the keys on this keyboard are very well damped in terms of the sound the produce.  It's very muted, even with my hard strokes.  One thing that will take some adjusting to is the increased curvature (along two different planes) between where your pinky and index fingers rest (A,F and J,;).  Whereas the older keyboards have a relatively flat incline, this keyboard has a slight curve (concave).  In addition, there is also a very subtle curve across the keyboard as well (a horizontal curvature), which seems a more natural fit for the shape of hands.  Also of note is the fact that some of the keys have changed shape.  Whereas previously, MS had kept the striking surface consistent across the different keys (even at the edge), this keyboard has several keys along the ridge that have different striking surfaces.

Interestingly, this keyboard also features the return of the front riser (available on the older versions of the MS ergo keyboards).  Actually, in recent months, I've been doing exactly this, but with my own ad hoc methods :) This is a much better solution.  The riser is easily removable for those that prefer the standard configurations.

Note that this keyboard is *USB only*, which means that it may be incompatible with some older motherboards.  Not a problem for me as I'm using it with a newer laptop.  The keyboard does come with software for the programmable keys and extra functions, but it's plug and play right out of the box with WinXP.

I also appreciate the new forward and back buttons for use with web browsing (work with no drivers).  The zoom slider in the middle of the keyboard, however, seems inapproriately used.  It would have been much more useful as a scroll slider instead.

Sizewise, it takes up slightly more surface space than my wireless elite, but is much, much thinner.

My only complaints are that the space key is a little bit stiff out of the box (maybe it'll loosen up a bit after usage), the distance from Ctrl to the number keys seems to have increased a bit (on the scale of millimeters, this is important for those of us hitting Ctrl+F5 quite often ;-), the Delete key is now the same size as the other keys in the cluster (which some people may prefer, but I need to adjust to due to the extra large delete key on the Wireless Elite set), the Enter key is slightly smaller (by 3-5mm), and the key response is not as ""soft"" as say the ones I recently sampled on the MS bluetooth keyboard, but still very comfortable.

Overall, a very high quality keyboard.  If you can wait, there is sure to be a wireless version coming soon.  But anyone that spends a significant amount of type working with computers will be able to appreciate the new layout after 1-2 days of adjustment to the new curvature.  I'm very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend this keyboard to my fellow programmers :)

UPDATE: In the past few days, I've had an inquiry into whether I'm still satisfied with the keyboard.  The answer is a big, bold *YES*.  As I was telling a colleague, this keyboard simply rocks.  I can type hours on end without pain.  My ""seat of the pants"" impression is that I also type _faster_ with this keyboard.  As I pointed out above, I think that most people will have to go through a period of adjustment to really feel comfortable and fall  in love with this keyboard, even if you're coming from a previous Microsoft Ergo series keyboard.",Best Overall Keyboard to Date,1129593600,

I was looking for a new home keyboard to replace the one from the MS Wireless Optical Desktop Comfort Edition (which is also a fine keyboard - if you're not a gamer; see the reviews for details).  While I liked the comfort curve keyboard, it wasn't a true ergonomic, and it gave me problems in gaming.  So when I saw that MS had redone the Natural Keyboard Pro, I jumped on it.  The reverse slope feels different at first but it isn't difficult to get used to at all.  The attachment does come off if you don't like it though.  The keyboard feels very well put together, typical of MS periphrials in my experience.

I noticed that one user had complained about the software.  If you've used Intellitype before, don't expect anything new in version 5.3, which ships with this keyboard.  As far as I can tell, the only thing added was support for the new keyboards.  I have no major faults with it, although I've never owned a Logitech keyboard so I'm unable to compare it with their software.

The only downsides to this keyboard are that the keys, despite having good feel and feedback are pretty quiet; it's not a clicky keyboard.  Also, with the reverse slope attachment on, it's a very high keyboard, something to keep in mind if you use a keyboard drawer or tray.  My tray will not quite slide under the desk anymore with this keyboard on it.  Still, these are minor faults with an otherwise excellent product.",Best keyboard I've used,1129075200,
2,B000A6PPOK,Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000,4.0,11,True,"10 5, 2005",AFPGV3IQ9K691,{'Style:': ' Retail'},GDC,"As with most Microsoft products, great hardware, poor software, but oh well.

Now I'm using this thing right now, and I never noticed the spacebar thing, but it's true, if you don't press the spacebar correctly and press it on the upper area, it's hard to press down. I've always pressed spacebars as they were meant to be pressed so I had no issues adjusting.

The largest challenge with this keyboard is using home row correctly, Microsoft puts out products based on the standard, and has done this with its' Natural line since the start. I use my left hand correctly, my right, on my Logitech Elite, went all over the place; I can only imagine how wrong my right hand usage was. This keyboard forces you to relearn typing, for typing classes, a Natural keyboard would be perfect, it makes you type correctly. I don't much like the N key, but I've learned to use it and the M key correctly, no more hitting my enter key while going for quotes either.

The zoom function is novelty, not necessity, it's fun to use normally but mostly useless otherwise, really exclusively for the always-in-office user, what they need to do is make it a scroll button too, it's highly sensitive and easy to use, which would make scrolling silky smooth in a way only overpriced mice manage.

Therein lies the problem, the software is inferior to my cheapie Logitech Elite(Which had more functions I might add as well as better software.), there is hardly any customization to be had. There is no taskbar icon; most of the remapping done is through an interface integrated into the already well-hidden Keyboard area under the control panel. Remapping options are less than fantastic, the favorites keys are useless, the back and forward buttons will work with either a browser or a media player, not both, zoom cannot be reconfigured, and Mail only allows one indicated program to be opened.

This is what is wrong with the favorite's keys, they allow but five programs to be opened, you cannot indicate that you wish to open a menu of programs to select, merely one program per key, same with all of the other keys. The lack of ""My"" keys for the F# Buttons is annoying, but that's just a design decision for a non-media keyboard, and I don't mind much.

This keyboard would've done better to have more configuration and just a couple more media keys, but I suppose it's my fault for asking that much of it, it's designed for the office, not a music listeners hands. I'll go into the aesthetics of this baby now to round it off.

Some may notice the shift keys are smaller, and the enter key even smaller, the right of the keyboard is larger than the left in the way of keys, which seems fine, to me at least, I find reaching the Backspace key uncomfortable, placing your hands on this keyboard is like a match made in heaven, seems a shame to reach so far away and break off from paradise.

That leads me to this palm rest, wow, sick of those cheap detachable plastic palm rests(Read: Wrist Destroyers)? This is your ticket, so soft, yet strong, it's the cashmere of palm wrests. The 2x3 layout is back to normal, which I very much enjoy, insert is back home and delete is too. The keys above the numpad offer more functions that I have yet to use, but are nice to have all the same, the curvature of the keys takes getting used to, particularly the aforementioned N key and it's sibling the M key. The Alt, Ctrl, Windows, Menu, and Start keys are all gigantic and hard to miss, they feel pretty great.

The spacebar, apparently if struck correctly, is amazing, it's designed for this keyboard in a way that no spacebar has ever been, it's almost destructive of what you're typing looking down while you type, seeing it all functioning the way it does, it's almost like some kind of alien technology, which is why I don't look.

The...crappy plastic attachment that comes attached(Oddly enough) to this masterpiece is best taken out(Easily) and forgotten, it's all personal preference of course, I didn't like it, the slope of the keys makes leaving your hands where they are painless and then very comfortable. The prop-ups on the back make it more conventional and I rather like them, but now the size.

This keyboard is undeniably the largest keyboard I have ever laid eyes on, the sheer width and height is enough to make a laptop user gawk for moments at a time, it is critical you have a large amount of desk space to place this on, I didn't, and I had to move my entire PC over more to the left just to manage a nice cozy fit. When the legs on this baby are propped it also reaches monitor height, I.E., it will not fit very well under a monitor, which is why it is best used in a keyboard tray, though I'd worry about it's large scale hurting the tray after a long enough time.

In conclusion, this is a masterful piece of hardware, and it has virtually no flaws, the software is pathetic at best and obviously designed for the dullard worker drone, it's a pity really, all the same, it deserves four stars, here's to hoping they manage to improve the boring, bland software.

I liked it so much that it recently came time to replace our wireless keyboard at home (Logitech Wave) because we lost the dongle and it was too old to buy a replacement dongle.  I had wanted wireless again but there seemed to be a lot of connectivity issues with the ergonomic keyboards I was reviewing.  I knew this MS keyboard was solid given the years I've used it at work, so I bought one for my home office.  My wife loves it (she doesn't usually care about any techy purchases) and I'm pleased to have the same quality and comfort at home that I've enjoyed at work for so many years.  I do wish it was wireless but now I don't have to worry about connectivity or battery issues so I'm satisfied.",Excellent quality (been using it for years at work) and comfort,1520380800,

I've spent hundreds of dollars on other keyboards (fully-detachable, mechanical, etc.), but this one, at only $35, easily beats them all.  The feel of the keyboard is truly natural.

Some things that I would have liked to have seen:
*additional 6 key on the right
* additional B key on the right
*no number pad
*programmable keys

Additionally, the space bar makes an incredible amount of noise.  It's like 10 times the loudness of the other keys.  The shortcuts don't work for me (I primarily use a Mac), and they don't really look all that helpful anyway (using the dedicated undo button on the top row of the keyboard vs. just using the ctrl/cmd + z motion).

I didn't think i needed anything more ergonomic until my wrists started hurting and my posture started to 'collapse'. Nothing major, I haven't seen a physical therapist or anything, but I figured I needed to make a change. I remember one of my friends has gone through quite a few of these keyboards so I figured why not. I also didn't want to spend a lot.

So here I am typing on it right now after a week of getting used to it. I have to say that i generally find the key action to be a bit muddy. I have a mechanical keyboard and I also type on a lenovo laptop, so these feel mushy by comparison. They work fine though, and the sound is not as clicky, which I appreciate since I think I could do with less audio stimulation at work.

I have it connected to a KVM so I switche between a mac and pc which works fine for my needs. The volume control buttons work on both mac and windows which was a pleasant surprise.

My favorite feature is actually the palm rest. My hands sit pretty naturally there and i can type without feeling fatigued or any of the stress I had grown accustomed to  on my regular keyboards. I know my chair and desk aren't the best, but those things are not as easy to acquire as this keyboard. Because of the shape of the keyboard I can sit up straighter, longer.

<b>Show Stopper - Bad Spacebar</b>
This was basically an ""emergency"" purchase from Best Buy.  It was all they had in stock.  The demo unit I tested had a sticky spacebar.  Or so I thought.  I assumed it was due to it being a demo unit.  Sadly, my unboxed unit behaves the same.  This is common for poor quality keyboards, but the spacebar does not register well on the ends.  The closer to the center you press it the better off you are.  This is not okay for me, especially on an ergonomic keyboard. It's possible it will ""wear in"" but in my experience that isn't the case.

Other Thoughts:
Overall the layout is very good and comfort seems acceptable in my limited use.  I probably won't ever use any of the media buttons or the weird slider in the middle (zoom, I think?).  It's possible the ""Business Model"" here may not have the spacebar problem, but I wouldn't count on it.

It was a little tricky at first, but I got one for the house and the office. It have noticed that my wrists don't have the same ""tension"" in them using this keyboard and an ergo mouse.

I really only use the ""feature buttons"" at the top for volume control. The calculator button is sort of handy. Not exactly sure what the point of the zoom lever in the middle is supposed to be for, zooming in on web pages? images? videos? I don't use it. Or the ""Favorites"" button either. There are Back & Forward buttons just below the space bar as well, which are only handy in very rare situations when you need to step back and forth through your browser tabs history for some reason. There are 5 ""quick access"" buttons that you can program to do different things, apparently. Don't really use them either. Nor do I use any of the F-Lock functions for writing emails from.... (probably) Outlook? I'm a fan of the right hand number pad though.

The feet on the bottom top side prop up the keyboard slightly. I used to flip them up and down sometimes for a few days at a time just to get a slightly different ""mixture"" of wrist strain. I had something kind of heavy fall onto the keyboard in the center and it snapped off both feet, but the keyboard is still chuggin' away at full functionality, so its rather ""tough"" as long as you don't spill anything into the cracks between keys.

I killed one of these keyboards a few years ago with about 1/3 cup of water spilled into the F1 through F5 keys and I lost the ""4"" / ""$"" key, which is NOT awesome for someone who codes. The labels were started to wear off of the keys though, so it wasn't a short life. I usually keep 2 at a time and leave the ""nicer"" of the 2 at the office so my desk looks a little more presentable. My ""warrior board"" at home has all the battle scars. The vinyl covering and the bottom of the keyboard that covers the ""palm rest"" area can start to peel and crack sometimes if you REALLY go hard for awhile. Just pick off the big chunks so it doesn't stick to you. The exposed Styrofoam-like underneath of the pad is still just as ""soft"" and actually looks better than having half peeled and cracked vinyl. Or leave it peeling. It adds some character. Like you know what you are doing or something.

You will need to flip it over and slap out the crumbs, dust, hair and other crud that gets into the crevices every now and then. Sometimes I like to save it up and wait until I get a chance to gross out the ladies with it by doing it front of them.

I've heard the wireless version of this keyboard blows through batteries pretty quickly. What the heck do you need an ergonomic keyboard to be wireless for exactly?... I suggest sticking with the USB ""wired"" version if you want a keyboard that wears its scars like accomplishments, yo. Like gangsters' teardrops or whatever.

I don't really count how many keystrokes I use on each keyboard, but this is the ONLY keyboard that has lasted so long the labels on the keys are almost totally gone on 5 of the keys and its still functioning good as new, aside from a few laptop keyboards, maybe. I do occasionally wipe the keys down gently with a paper towel soaked in rubbing alcohol when the PC is powered down. Because = germs and whatnot. Tap out the crud BEFORE you wipe it down and don't let so much of the alcohol drop between the keys that it won't dry within seconds though.

The best part about the keyboard is the design ergonomic and it is a pretty freaking durable keyboard as long as it NEVER gets wet IN the keys.

1) Comfortable for hands and wrists.  No more pain from typing.
2) wired design is practical, no need for batteries
3) some useful shortcut buttons, such as volume control (plus mute), and calculator

Cons:
1) Very LOUD spacebar.  I actually appreciate the sound of a nice clicky keyboard, but this spacebar makes a big old THUNK ever time you hit it, way louder than the other keys.  Loud enough to wake up my husband sleeping in the same room.

2) Within a short time, the white key markings started to wear off, to the point where I eventually had to buy replacement stickers.  (These stickers then also started to come off, leaving gummy residue behind...)

3) The deal breaker: Eventual sudden death of the keyboard when several keys stopped responding.  I have had 2 of these keyboards (for work and home), and both had this same problem within a couple months of each other.  For both, the top row of numbers were affected, as well as some other randomly located letters and number pad keys.

I initially had trouble with the space bar requiring too much force, but I adjusted to that within a few days. My main complaint about this keyboard is that there is no information about the ""f-lock"" key. I had never heard of such a thing, and I use my function keys (particularly Shift + F3 to change case) a lot. I could not figure out why my function keys weren't working. I am a medical writer, so I spend a lot of time on my computer, and I tend to be fairly technically savvy about such things. Neither I nor my editor could figure it out. When I finally figured it out (with help from yet another person), we realized the f-lock key was the issue and located it and toggled it back on. I then needed to reset the functionality for the Shift + F3 key because in the process of trying to reset it earlier, I had erased its function. It was a big pain and took way more of my time than it should have. I guess some people need an f-lock key? It seems like overkill to me, and it caused me quite a bit of frustration.

I've owned both the consumer and ""Pro"" (OEM) versions. I love this layout, and it's a must have if you live by virtue of your keystrokes. So why the lower score?  The front (pedestal or ""fence"" as I use it) would not firmly snap into the leftmost slot and had a sloppy fit overall. The keyboard seemed to be a bit stiffer and require a deeper stroke but that may be due to it's newness. The action was smooth, Keys not quite as ""clicky"" as the 2014 model.  I use the :""fence to center the keyboard in my lap so no matter how I shift my seating around my fingers are always on  home keys. The pedestal fence issue cost this keyboard two stars, I ordered this model hoping for the brown boxed bulk OEM ""professional"" model. Dell and other distribution channels seem to be out of stock on the OEM bulk model.  I received a blue box similar to the red retail boxes with the latest KU-0462 which has the same large centered key cap labels as consumer model. The business model I'm used to has smaller offset letters in upper left of keys that last longer. A slightly longer cable, and is supposed to be more spill resistant and robust. In the past the business model also had real arrows on the cursor keys and the keyboard bezel had labels such as ""Favorites"" ""Forward"" , ""Back"" etc. The large centered key cap lettering cost this keyboard another star because it won't last long. I contacted the seller regarding my concerns and was issued a lightning fast refund. Seller gets five stars for communication and service.
 I'm somewhat concerned that perhaps MS is only making one 4000 model now.  There's no hope in trying to find a map to models and versions of this keyboard, it's undergone major revisions over the years and despite these improvements all models are 1048  ""V 1.""  All previous models have a design flaw in the internal shielded cable routing.  The shielded cable is bent at a sharp 180 to an S before passing through the grommet at the rear of the keyboard, causing a good deal of stressing to the shielding braid which will break and conductors will fail if the cable flexes often. If you use the keyboard in your lap (best ergonomic position) as I do the cable will fail every couple of years or so if preventative measures aren't taken to reduce flexing at the external grommet interface using something like sugru -a great tip from my friend Cindy. For a desktop user the cable shouldn't fail as quickly.  Also noted on the keyboard I received the label on back no longer says designed in Redmond, WA. Rather mentions an operation in Ireland instead. The label was solid black background and there was no holographic Microsoft security sticker that I could impress my cat with.

If you use this keyboard many hours a day, use the front pedestal to stabilize the KB in your lap for home finger placement and your wrist pain will be a thing of the past.  I work on a couch now and mouse on the cushion next to me. My wrists are never bent, elbows/shoulders never stressed.

The softest touch activates it. Then when I press it down with normal intent, it sometimes skips a space. HORRIBLE! Taking it back.

EDIT: For those having this issue, it's probably the below, and here's how I fixed it:
Remove top of keyboard (requires popping off the space bar from above because there are screws under it that need to be removed (all of them). There is one snap-off part near the 'End' key.
The clear plastic sheeting with the electrode lines (don't know what to call them) that sit under all the keys, these sheets are 2 layers. It's when the top layer touches the bottom layer that the keystroke is executed. You'll notice a small circular cut-out (I think) on the bottom sheet, that puts a tiny space between the 2 layers. It's when this space is taken up by a button push that the keystroke is executed.

If you lift up the clear plastic from the space bar button, you'll notice a kind of plastic grid that the sheeting sits on for the space bar. If you look at this plastic grid, in the center is a little circular part that extends above the grid slightly. This little circular part is directly below the very center of the space bar button and is where the 2 clear plastic sheets with the electrodes sit during a space bar press. This circular part is pushing the bottom sheet up so that there is less space between the sheets than any other key. I took a small razor knife and made that center circular part of the grid flush with the other parts. This was the fix. Be careful not to carve that piece down below flush.

Pros:

Keys are solid and responsive to the touch.
The shortcut keys across the top work well and are very handy
Keyboard is study and appears to be built to last
The ""slant"" of keyboard is natural and takes pressure off of wrists
Loads with windows without needing any drivers etc
I've had zero problems so far with any features thus far

Cons:
The position of the keys are very awkward, I'm not really sure why. I'm still having a difficult time of typing without looking at keys even though I've used Ergonomic keyboards before. It's as if the spacing of them is slightly different.

Like other reviewers have noted, you have to hit it right in the middle, hard, to get it to register. This will create problems for your thumb joint. It also means that if you are a touch typist, you will inadvertently create a lot of typos where the space is missing, that you will have to go back to correct with the mouse. This is even worse, at least in my case, because my biggest problems are from using the mouse too much. Do you remember in the movie The Jerk where Steve Martin invents a little handle on people's glasses to prevent them from sliding down their nose, makes a million dollars, then loses a million dollars because people sue him because they all go cross-eyed? Yep, it's kind of like that.

***March 17, 2017***
I'm updating my review and changing it from three stars to one, and here's why. The only reason someone goes to the effort to hunt down and pay extra for an ergonomic keyboard is because they are having problems in their hands or wrists, and if you are having problems in your hands and wrists, you will end up tossing this keyboard in the garbage, as I will do today.

Also, the price on Amazon is much better than my local stores. I highly recommend this keyboard!

Update: The only downside of this keyboard is the spacebar. It's really loud! I googled solutions and this appears to be a typical problem. The solutions get pretty creative and always involved taking the spacebar off and gluing or bending something. As I understand, the problem lies with the design.

It did admirably, but after a year or so, my wrists were starting to hurt IN SPITE OF the ergonomics helping.  This one is better rated.  So far, it has helped, but it took at least a week of use just for my hands to BEGIN to get used to the differences.  I'd do a pro/con list, but I'm not sure there are any ""cons"" as compared to ""issues to expect"" if you buy this keyboard.

1.  Expect a steep learning curve to get used to the layout.  The ""bend"" in this keyboard is significant, and it will take time for your fingers to get used to hitting the right keys on a consistent basis.  Give it one or two weeks of regular use before deciding if you like it or not.  You can't know in a couple of days if it's helping you because you do need to re-learn your hand placement and fingering to some degree.

2.  There is a physical break in the left and right hand keys.  This ""no man's land"" means you need to unlearn using the wrong hand for the wrong keys because you will either miskey or just hit nothing when you go to use your right hand to it the G key (or a similar situation).  Likewise, some of the keys have an odd shape that takes getting used to.  I had considerable issue getting used to hitting V and B correctly.  Again, this is all about relearning how to keyboard properly.  My best tip is to avoid looking at the keyboard while typing.  For me, looking at the keyboard made it harder compared to just backspacing and repeating until I got it right.  Passwords are about the only thing where I still watch what keys I strike.

3.  This keyboard is wider and ""taller"" than most.  If you use a keyboard tray, clearing it might pose and issue (see next point below).  You will likely have less room for your mouse as well, but I found it something I could live with.

4.  The keyboard has three (maybe four) resting positions.  There's a removable front skirt that elevates the front.  There are the standard rear folding supports to elevate the rear.  So, that's resting flat (none), rear elevated, front elevated, and both elevated.  Lying flat, the keyboard works fine with my keyboard tray.  Set the way I find it's most comfortable for me, I can only push the tray in halfway before the keyboard hits the desk.  This isn't a deal breaker for me, so I'll live with it.  You keyboard tray may need to allow at least 3 inches of vertical clearance to not have an issue with this keyboard.

I was divided on four or five stars, but since I need this more extreme curve to deal with wrist pain, it's not the product's fault, so I won't hold the awkwardness of it against the designers.  It does what it's designed to do for a good reason.  That comes with a trade off.",Good keyboard but it takes time to adjust.,1483401600,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51IWxQOEtaL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51LGpteWxzL._SY88.jpg']"

Microsoft may not be behind this, but it's impossible to get beyond ranks of defensive operators to speak with anyone related to its design and manufacture - always a great fault of MS.

Spacebar is a bit loud. I guess it's the nature of having a solid, long and curved key for this particular keyboard. This is my 3rd one like this and all are the same loudness.

With only 2+ months of use, still hard to tell how durable this will be over time. The keys are a little noisier than what I would like, especially the space bar which requires a heavier push. I really enjoy the additional keys that are available on the top. For work, they come in handy. As per other reviews, it would be great to change the center scroll from a magnify to a scroll up/down function. Operating on windows 10, I've attempted to change that function in the command script but for some reason it will not. Not a big deal but then it just feels like it's just there for no reason. I give this a 4 stars because there are flaws. With the lifted base attached, I noticed that when I rest both my palms on the keyboard, the keyboard would warp/bend ever so slightly that the space bar would get caught on the edge and not pop back up. I would have to take some weight off and then it would return, which is unfortunate because I really liked that option. Another is that there is a mystery key/function that this keyboard keeps engaging at random intervals and I cannot figure out what it is. As I'm typing this, it goes unnoticed but when I'm typing a new email in outlook, I will get a ""continue without saving?"" window message that I did not engage.

No sticky keys yet, and space bar easy to press after 11 month of heavy usage. Additional keys above numpad keys, very useful for those who use calculator a lot.
It would have deserve 5 stars if labels wouldn't wear off in less then a year.

So there are a few issues with it:

1) the labels start wear off in about 6-8 month

2) they F keys are labeled for MS Office in mind, for example F5 key is labeled as ""Open"" and F9 as ""Send"", the actual F1-F12 labels are located on the vertical side toward person, which makes it hard to see in not very well lit environment, like with light from the monitor is not enough to see the labels.

3) F-Lock key is in bad position, easy mistake it for F12 key. It should have been totally separate like media buttons.

4) CTRL keys have a ""star"" (asteric) on it - what is it for? Is there a fine print somewhere for these buttons? Weird.

5) LED indicators don't have labels...instead they have icons that also printed on keys themselves. For example Caps Lock is marked as ""A"" in a square box and Num Lock as ""1"" in a square box. Who came up with this nonsense???
Also, LED indicators are in weird location compare to majority other keyboards, it would be perfect if they were integrated into the keys (Caps Lock, Scroll Lock, Num Lock, F Lock)

6) this keyboard is not good for gaming, because it doesn't recognize combinations of some 3 buttons, for example key T, G and B doesn't register when pressed both A and S keys (or A and W). Y, H and N key doesn't register when pressed both D and S or D and W.

I've been using for a year and I generally like it.  The pad is comfortable on my hand and after more than a year, it hasn't started to peel or anything from the oils of my hand.
Keys have held up well and the shortcuts on top are mildly helpful (I'm not big on the shortcuts except volume and calculator - but there are assignable buttons for those who want to customize).
I will say that the keyboard is not the quietest and I do find the space bar to have a little more resistance than I was first used to - I only noticed it because I edit videos and use the space bar to play/pause many, many times in an edit.  I've gotten used to it, but if I had known before, I might have picked a different keyboard with less resistance and sound in the space bar (when you let go the space bar, there is a bit of a thunk that is distinctive from the other keys - not too bad, but in those little OCD moments...it's a little annoying).

I'm using it on my Windows 10 computer.

My previous keyboard was a Logitech Wave ergonomic one, and this one is similar, but has a bit more of a gap/divide/space between the left and right-hand keys, and the curves in the keyboard are a little more extreme - so that'll take a little getting used to.

The only two 'special' keys I really used on my Logitech keyboard were the calculator button and the 'sleep' button - I was really disappointed that this Microsoft keyboard didn't have a sleep button. I was able to program the top/left button to put my computer to sleep, but it took a bit of work. First, I had to go to the microsoft website and look up this keyboard, and download the ""Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center"" software. Then I brought up the software, clicked the key on the virtual keyboard I wanted to program, and put in the following code to run when I press that button ""rundll32.exe powrprof.dll,SetSuspendState 0,1,0"". But 'hibernate' mode is turned on in Win10 by default, so that command makes my computer hibernate instead of sleep (and I have to use the power button to wake it, and it takes way longer than waking out of sleep). So I had to run a command prompt window in administrator mode, and run ""powercfg.exe /hibernate off"". Now I've got a sleep button, that makes my computer sleep, just like my Logitech keyboard did.

I've used this one (maybe with slight model changes) for years now. I was sold on the idea by a Best Buy employee (back when they really knew their stuff) after he explained that a keyboard should be arranged in the natural fall of the hand. Not only does this keyboard offer the adjusted direction of the keys but also the raised front, something that most keyboards miss but avoids the depressed wrist that often contributes to tendonitis. This model has always worked immediately after plugging in with various computers over the years. The padding for the pads of your hands is comfortable, even after many hours. You can keep your hands above the pad (which is probably a more proper technique), even when the keyboard is raised if your desk and seat are properly fitted. I will confess that I have gone through several of these keyboards over the years, but every time the malfunctions were due to a stupid person spilling a lot of liquid on the keyboard (that person being me). They have survived small splatters just fine, but no keyboard will survive large amounts of liquid. A destroyed keyboard became a great practice toy for my children, so they are even useful in death.

So I've been typing without it for about 2 years, and I finally decided to go back.

Pros:  the natural hand position does put much less strain on your wrists. I specifically notice it in my pinky finger on my left hand.  I'm able to switch between this keyboard and my laptop keyboard without any problem at all. It doesn't slow me down at all.

Another pro- all of the quick favorite buttons at the top are wonderful. Once set up right you can open your email program (outlook) a web browser, and 5 other programs at the touch of a button. Super convenient, and really easy to set up.

Con- this is about the only one, but the keyboard is rather large. While it fits on my under desk drawer it won't slide under the desk. This isn't too big of a deal, but it could be a problem for some people.","Very comfortable, Easy to adjust to keyboard!",1472774400,

I really want to love it, as it's set up exactly how I like my keyboards to be, but it has one critical error. I've owned 3 of them in the last six months. They just don't last very long. :( I don't work from home or do excessive typing. They're not getting anything spilled on them or suffering any sort of crazy abuse, so I can't fathom why they don't last very long, but that's their critical downside. In fact, the keys that went bad on this last board aren't even the keys I use very often. The entire j,k,l,;,', panel went dead, as well as the 5,6,7,8,9,0,-,=, (backspace), section. Just out of the blue, in the middle of typing a search into google.  The home row keys went dead on my last one, and that was the same issue with the first one I purchased.

I've kept coming back because I like that the keys aren't spongy or too firm, they're just right. The size of the board and the comfort level are superb as well. Unfortunately, I won't be purchasing it anymore, as $30 every couple of months is just too steep for me.

My thoughts and criteria for products I review based on the Amazon's rating criteria
 = Amazed by the product! The product was nearly if not perfect! I will purchase again and/or recommend to my friends and family! Exceeds expectations and is a great product!
 = Like the product. Product is as described and the quality is not lacking. Might have small things I would change, but no big issues. Would recommend is brought up but don't just love it.
 = This product is just okay. There are pros and there are cons. Im not positive if I will continue to use it. This is a product that might work better for someone else but just doesnt work great for me. Could be worth purchasing for someone else.
 = Not a fan of this product. Wouldnt use the product again and wouldnt recommend it, but I might still have one positive thing to say about the product.
 = I hate this product. I will never use this product and maybe nothing else from the seller again. Its either throw away or return, not safe to use, or just not worth anything. Definitely wouldnt recommend and have nothing good to say about the product.

Having thought about this keyboard over the last year and then swapping it out for a standard Dell (non ergonomic) keyboard for the last two weeks has made me realize a few and not so few obvious things:

1) Footprint of ergonomic keyboard on desk is larger than most that I can recall. Not a con but keep that in mind if your computer desk is on the smaller side
2) Build Quality. You buy a top tier (Microsoft, Dell, Lenovo, HP, etc) business OR retail keyboard for a decent price, one EXPECTS minimal issues. There are two issues that have cropped up over the course of the last year: a couple of the tabs holding the snap on palm rest have broken off. The palm rest/riser plastic piece is still firmly attached. My guess is that these plastic clips were put in high stress areas. No loss in functionality. The CAPS LOCK LED light that is in the middle doesn't really work anymore. If I hit the caps lock with my left pinkie finger, the light doesn't come on. If I smash the same caps lock with my thumb or index finger, the light comes on and then goes out. Windows 10 always tells me via the popup message if my caps lock is on. No loss in functionality.
3) Key labels have not worn off. The letters are a bit faded but are still clear. The number row above the keys are virtually pristine (and by extension are used for the comparison of the letter keys).
4) This is a very good ergonomic keyboard. Within a couple of days of the swap, my wrist and left finger were starting to have that familiar hurt.

I could go on and on about the specifics that some have posted in other reviews, but I feel that this is relevant to my use after a full year",1 Year Later....Still going Great,1467590400,

It was about 90% plug and play on my Linux system. On Windows, there's a special driver to make sure everything works, but no such thing for Linux. Still, almost all the keys worked and it was completely usable. With a few relatively easy configuration changes I was able to get 100% of the keys working as they should. That's very satisfactory. I put maybe 20 minutes into it, compared with the 5 minutes I would have spent installing a driver on Windows. So overall, Microsoft has played fair here and there are no show-stopping incompatibilities, in fact really none at all.

The keyboard has a rich set of functions and features. It takes a little getting used to if you want to get the most out of it, but you can do this ""as you go."" The keyboard is usable as a simple keyboard right from the get-go.

Also on the positive side is that the keyboard is relatively quiet. It's not as quiet as some super-silent keyboards that I've used, but I like the idea that there's just enough audible feedback, which, combined with excellent tactile feedback, leads to more accurate typing.

The keyboard is a little bulky but on the other hand it rests stably on the work surface and doesn't scoot around like some lightweight keyboards.

So, what about the vaunted ergo features?

First, there's a gadget provided that changes the tilt of the keyboard and supposedly provides ergo advantages. I took it off right away; I couldn't get used to the rather extreme tilt downward. Maybe I should have given it a chance but I really hated it. Your mileage may certainly vary.

The wrist rest is comfortable and provides good support. Now, the main feature; the split of the keyboard into two ""sides"" and the angling that goes with it, really takes some accustomization. I mean, really. Even after a couple of months there are some things I find strange and more difficult. I'm a big Emacs user and so the control key comes into play often, and I have caps lock mapped as an extra control key. The ""reaches"" are strange and I've had to alter finger usage to deal with this. But don't give up; after some practice, regular typing is fast and comfortable. The layout of the keys is sensible and generally works pretty well.

The biggest issue, and why I rate this four stars overall, is the spacebar. It takes a lot more force to depress it than it ought to, and it's something you use a lot, so it's a problem. There is a lot online about how to fix the spacebar, but you shouldn't have to.

To be fair, I didn't apply any of the fixes, and with usage, I learned the best way to use the spacebar (pulling my thumb to the side a little). Also, it's loosened up a little with repeated use. But this is a real design flaw.

Do I recommend this keyboard? You can get a Logitech for more money, but I think this keyboard is about right for the price, so I give it a guarded recommendation. You've got to give it time. Don't expect to be a pro with it the first few days. And you've got to learn to work with the spacebar.","Good compatibility, overall good utility",1463788800,

Very pleased with the decreased tension in my fingers: as a musician and researcher, I'm constantly on my computers, and I detest that time much less with this keyboard.  The Apple keyboards (and pretty much all laptop / tablet interfaces) are designed by a powerful secretive elite with ties to the shadowy Carpal Tunnel Cartels, and for once Microsoft is on the moral high-ground.

MAC OSX COMPATIBILITY: C-.  The keyboard works fairly well with both my MacBook Pro and my desktop iMac (both currently running El Capitan OSX 10.11.4), but strips them down to basics.

The keyboard gets points for plug and play: you have to ""introduce"" the device to OSX, but it's painless and quick.  Moreover, some special function keys seem to be ready to go out of the box: the volume keys, for instance, work as expected.  ""Play"" calls up your default music app.

But other special function keys aren't recognized: Mail, screen brightness, and the zoom slider don't work.  Some freeware apps can map those for you, but if you're all about right-out-of-the-box, think twice.",Very pleased with the decreased tension in my fingers,1462924800,

I am still using it and just now getting around to writing my review. What can I say? I like to be thorough - especially for things that you want to last for the long haul.

Let's see, my uses included - school, work, and for a season, some gaming, but nothing too crazy or extensive in that arena (true gamers are more hardcore about it than I am).

My studies and profession include architecture and audio engineering. I have used it with many different programs and general computer use and liked it so much I used it at work and at home. My use has only been on PC with it, so I have no idea about it's use with Apple products. I've used it with Win '98, NT, 2000, XP, Vista, 7premium in various makes of PC's and even laptops.

I will say the initial use of it (perhaps a week at the time) was slightly odd, however, after that it is very bizarre using a straight rectangular keyboard. The ergonomic feel is great and very natural with my wrists. I am a male, about 5'-9"", weight about 200 lbs (give or take 10 lbs depending on life) with thick hands - strong but with a sensitive touch in case you were wanting to put a physique with the review and see if you are in the same ballpark for reference.

My professions have had me on the computer daily and I can attest to the durability as well as comfort of this keyboard. The key springs are strong but not so much that it feels like your trying to crawl out of a collapsed clay cave.

The shortcuts are good, and I have never ran into any issues with the keyboard not connecting or any misfiring with any of the selected buttons or features. The kickstands initially I did not like, but now I do because of the table placement.

All I can say is that this is by far my favorite keyboard to use on a computer and even spec them for any work computers if I have the chance - and even if I don't, I can bring my trusty one. Mine was purchased in 2006, and is still going strong, I am assuming the current ones are still that well made.

Oh, also, I have used it in an architectural office where we used laptops primarily and docking stations and it worked like a charm.

Get this keyboard, make it through the first week or few of acclimating to it, and then watch your computational life behind this keyboard change. Well, maybe not that much, but you will be comfortable and wonder how you used those rectangular ones for so long once you do enjoy the comfort of this keyboard.",I like to be thorough - especially for things that you ...,1462752000,

The letter ""Y"" had been an ambi-letter for me where I used both my right and left hand so I do miss the ability to reach over to ""Y"" with my left-hand now, but for the comfort gained from this super cheap $20 keyboard, not much of a sacrifice.

The 10-key portion, I do wish that the NumLock key and the ""="" key would switch places.
Do people switch NumLock On and Off that frequently?
For Excel formulas, yes, you can start a formula with ""+"", but still, they're technically supposed to start off with an ""="" and it would make things much easier, making it quicker...
Or it would have been nice to make the 10-key portion all one clump, making it more reachable and I have decently big hands...
But, I assume they placed that slight distance for sake of uniformity/aesthetics.

Yet, the option of ""="", ""("", "")"" and a backspace right above the 10-key portion is very Excel friendly and appreciated.
I just need to program myself to remember that.

If you have the desk-space and type a lot and/or use Excel a lot, this keyboard is definitely a must-buy.
Oh!! And the ""command key"" or the ""right-click key"" on the bottom right, in between the Alt and Ctrl key is so awesome!!

Let me be the first to belay any misgivings regarding 'one star ratings' based upon usage ease/difficulty. If you know your home row keys, and are accustomed to typing by touch, this Ergo Keyboard by Microsoft will feel as though your fingers are flying across the keys! I kid you not! I've just gotten it today, have set it up, and am typing on it right now! It is the most natural feeling I've ever experienced while typing! Now all I need is a foot board, and I'll be in heaven. If you're a writer, typist, or programmer, what have you, you will indeed benefit from this keyboard. It gives the option to move the keyboard up against the heels of your palms, or in a flatter position (in which I am presently typing). This design is ingenious, and being able to type as I normally do, with a few errors (while getting accustomed to key placement, etc. etc.) feeling little to no strain in my wrists or forearms is amazing!!

In my experience I cannot use it as I am used to a normal keyboard and do not want to take the time to learn how to use his keyboard (it's split down the middle of the keys with a large lump so that it feels better on the way your hands sit, however it makes typing a totally different experience and you sort of have to ""relearn"" how to type.) but he has had no issues and has been using that type of keyboard for years and years. Of all the ergonomic keyboards out there he likes this one model in particular (and as his break he likes that I order the SAME ONE.) because it has more of a raise in the keyboard than other ones do. He spilled milk on one and shorted some of the keys out and had me order the same exact keyboard, and then the one prior to that just went out after years of use and abuse. (He is an avid gamer, surfs the web, e-mail, social media, everything. Spends a lot of time at the computer.)
So if you're looking for the best ergonomic keyboard you're ever gonna find, this is it. But just realize if you're not used to the split keyboard feature (and it's not physically split I just mean the raised lump) you will have to spend some time getting used to it and re-learning how to type.

1. Open Start --> All Apps --> Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard (the software installed with the keyboard, download from microsoft.com if you don't have it)
2. Open the keyboard settings, then select a button to assign a macro for (e.g. for the Web / Home button)
3. Select the ""Macro"" radio button and click to create a new one, name the new macro ""sleep""
4. Insert the Windows Key via the ""Insert Special Keys"" droplist
5. Double click the Windows key to select it, then right click and choose ""split""
6. Insert an ""X"" between the Windows Keys- this will open the right click start menu
7. Move to the end of the macro, then type arrow keys up, up, right, down, and then press enter- this selects the ""sleep"" menu item
8. See the picture for how things should look in your editor when done
9. Exit the macro editor and test your new sleep key!

Sadly, the 4000 only lasts a few years, at best, and each new one I purchase seems to have lower build quality than the last one. Microsoft (and/or their supplier) seem to be shaving every last penny out of this keyboard. Yeah it looks the same, but lettering wears off the keys quickly, the space bar rattles and has poor response, and the keys have become more noisy and sloppy. The overall feel is far worse than the original 4000.

All the newer ""ergonomic"" keyboards are mostly wireless which has its own disadvantages. Microsoft has also dramatically changed the layout of the delete/home/end/etc. keys on their newer ergo keyboards (like the Sculpt models) and switched to even smaller barely usable function keys. Logitech has the big bloated ugly Wave which is also arguably worse than the 4000. So this keyboard remains the lesser evil among a poor selection of ergo options. I just wish Microsoft would come out with a ""4500"" with the same layout and proper two color injection molded keycaps (instead of cheap silkscreened letters that wear off), higher quality feel, and a better space bar mechanism. I'd gladly pay more for such a keyboard.

I don't like the newer type of ""wave"" keyboards, since you would still need to type with your two hands pressing close to each other like conventional keyboards.  I have not been much of a fan of Microsoft keyboards either as I find their keys spongy compared to Logitech keyboards.  But since Logitech no longer produces split type of ergonomic keyboards, I decided to give the Microsoft 4000 a try.  To my surprise, it is much better than I thought. The raised stand, together with the padded wrist rest, is very comfortable.  I also find myself adjusting to a healthier sitting position in tandem with this new keyboard.

Bennett,"Was unsure of the forward sloping design, but it's a winner, once you get used to it.  My wrists love it!  A little different approach to keyboard customization that may not be for the ""sunday afternoon"" computer user.  Takes a little understanding of computers and how to interact with them.  Nothing serious, but it's not as easy as some other approaches.  On the flip side, you can get a more complex and potentially useful custom key by building fairly complex key-stroke based macros into the customizable keys.  Very nice.

Keyboard touch and feel are good.  I fuss a little about the raised bar on the F and J home keys.  It is located on the lower edge of the key and I sometimes have to feel for it.  Prefer the raised dot in the center some other boards use but not a deal breaker.  Breakover point is quick, giving a crisp feel, not mushy.  The on board button to open the customization interface is a nice touch as is the zoom key in the middle.

In order to play Fallout 4 for example, I've put poster putty on keys to help find important keys more easily and also keep my fingers from pressing the wrong ones (especially tilde instead of tab, giving me the console instead of opening or closing the Pipboy/menu interface). For general typing, the keys are annoyingly slick and I find myself having to check finger placement because the little F and J marker nobs are easy to miss.

Also, who in their right mind would put a Function Lock key on a keyboard, especially RIGHT by the F12 key? Function keys are essential to a lot of games, and keys becoming suddenly unresponsive is not cool. Microsoft apparently thinks people only use keyboards for email anymore (which is what they've placed as primary labels and uses for the function keys, while the F-number labels get relegated to the side of the key). Bad Microsoft. No cookie for you.

Unfortunately this keyboard seems to be the only real option for the split-key style, so I'm sticking with it even though it sucks. On the plus side, the spacebar isn't giving me as much trouble as I expected, but it is quite noisy and I've probably learned to hit it harder by this point. I think I'll sum up my entire feelings about this keyboard in one word: blaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah.

Original review:

Keep in mind, this is an almost fresh-out-of-the-box review, with about 20 minutes of use. I got the retail version based on reviews saying the spacebar for the business edition is crap, and one review where a person bought both versions and said the retail keyboard's spacebar was better.

So, let's get right to the spacebar itself: it definitely needs a stronger press than the letter keys. The pressing-feel of the letter keys are smooth but the spacebar isn't, and the space has a definite thud/click to it while the letter keys are quiet (not truly silent, but definitely not clicky). Since the space does require a bit of extra push, it'll take some time to see how annoying it is... already not real impressed. Specifically for gaming, with left-hand centered over the WASD keys for movement, the spacebar does becoming notably harder to push properly. New learning of finger-placement to get the thumb further towards the center of the spacebar may do the trick, but that's frustrating because it's muscle-memory for gamers. This wouldn't be an issue if the manufacturer had designed the spacebar properly.

Also, the left-hand resting area with the ergonomic ""pillow"" (which is really just thin soft-ish vinyl-type material over the underlying plastic base) needs to be extended further left. The edge of my hand rests right on the edge, and that's not comfortable and also a little off-putting. The pillow-surface itself feels weirdly slimy due to the texture the manufacturers decided to use, and the keys themselves also feel a little weirdly-slick. This is even more noticeable on the spacebar just based off how much harder you have to push it. The more I use it, the more I get used to it, but it was very noticeable right off the bat... and the keys do have a slight texture to them that seems counter-intuitive to sliding. Coming from an old, very well-worn keyboard with very smooth keys from being so worn, I should not be noticing that the textured keys on a new keyboard feel slippery... but there it is.

Still, this seems like the best keyboard available for the split-key, ergonomic style. I got dragged kicking and screaming into purchasing this because my baby finally died... the trusty old Microsoft Natural Keyboard Elite that I've either never replaced or replaced once in the early 2000's (I honestly can't remember). Either way, my baby could no longer be called ""trusty"" due to a years-old short that would often press keys around the scroll-lock button when the keyboard was moved (resulting in random screenshots while playing games on Steam). Sometimes many or all keys would not work until after a thorough, careful cleaning disassembling everything and putting it back together after. The death-knell was when the short would stick one of the shift keys and possibly other function-related keys for an over-long amount of time, resulting in much frustrated key-pressing and faux-all-caps-rage until the thing finally behaved itself again. One cannot play something like an MMO with that kind of performance, and even chatting on instant messenger became obnoxious.

So I have retired my baby and am relegated to this thing. It... works, but it could definitely be done better. If it continues to preform as it does now, I will live with it... if it falls apart quickly, you'll be seeing a very unhappy update to this review. I got the 2-year protection plan just in case, and I'd recommend it since it's less than $3 and may be worth its weight in gold... way more than $3 worth of gold, obviously. Microsoft really needs to bring back the Elite, and all they really need to do is give it a USB plug. The saying is true: they really don't make 'em like they used to... it's all about shoddy everything now, because a well-made product means less future purchases. Sad fact, one the industry does not need to subscribe to but as we've seen over recent years, money beats honor. Shame.","not real impressed, but out of decent options after the grand old Elite died",1447286400,

It sits a couple inches off of the desk, which helps rest your palms in a more comfortable position for extended periods of typing.  The F1-F12 buttons having their features on the actual keys (Undo, Redo, Print, etc.) is extremely helpful and makes F# keys useful again.  The quick button for a calculator saves you from having to open Start->All Programs->Accessories->Calculator whenever you want to make a quick calculation.  The middle zoom in/out switch is an excellent feature but the best feature in my opinion, and the one I use the most, is the back/forward buttons at the bottom.  These double as buttons that you can use to easily navigate sheets on an Excel spreadsheet, which is extremely useful and intuitive.

CONS: I use the number pad a lot and it seems to miss punches from time to time.  I do not know if this is the keyboard's fault or mine, so I didn't count off for it.  It does seem to slide, especially on a freshly polished desk, but not enough to be too annoying.

One pitfall for first time users, the F-Lock button (on the right of the F12) toggles the function keys between their standard functions and different functions assigned by Microsoft. If for example the F3 or F5 are not behaving as expected, just press the F-Lock and all will be well again. I found out the hard way :)

There are many extra buttons, and there is customization and Microsoft software/firmware to install and tweak if you wish. The most unusual placements (but can be handy) are left/right arrows below the space-bar, a zoom button above the space bar, and a dedicated calculator button above Scroll Lock.

I feel like I'm especially qualified to give a review of this keyboard because I've probably owned a dozen or more.  I buy them 2 or 3 at a time.  Why?

I only choose to use wired keyboards only and so was happy to find such a functional keyboard that was also wired, which is harder to find these days as most hardware is made to be wireless.

It did take me a couple of days to get used to the split keyboard as I am a fast typist and found it awkward at first, but now it's extremely easy and second nature to use after a couple of days of use and am back to typing fast again!  The one key I tended to mistype consistently at first was the ""Y"" as the ""7"" key is right above it and the ""7"" key is very big, but that's resolved itself after 2-3 days of use.  I did find my spacebar was noisier to depress than other keys at first but now after 2-3 days of use it has the same, general quiet sound as the other keys.

I like to code, so it requires a ton of typing, lately I've noticed stiffness and some pain in my wrists, blatant CTS symptoms, I decided to get a nice ergonomic keyboard to maybe slow down the progress of CTS!
I just want to list a few pros and cons so that you can make your own decision!

PROS
* This keyboard is incredibly comfortable! You can't really tell, but your hands are typing at an angle, your thumbs are higher than your pinkies, so you're pushing inwards to the keyboard, I can type on this thing for hours without feeling stiff or any pain what so ever!

*The keys aren't mushy, they feel like mechanical keys, just with a little bit less resistance. It's hard to explain, but typing is satisfying, it doesn't require as much push as a mechanical keyboard, but it's not the hyper-sensitive Chiclets keys on a standard laptop keyboard, it's just responsive enough to where mis-presses are a thing of the past.

*It also comes with an attachment, it's a ""Raiser"" bar that sits underneath the palm wrest, it raises the keyboard quite a few inches off of your desk, this essentially forces you to be in an ergonomic pose, otherwise it's difficult to use, it really does help with all around comfort and I'm never taking it off! Although, if you don't like it, it's optional!

*It also has a ton of customizable buttons near the top! In the middle is a scroll wheel sort of deal, It's really convenient to have when I'm just browsing the internet, I can use one hand to browse long webpages. I re-bind it for certain games for a convenient melee switch!

CONS

*Nothing is perfect, the learning curve can be sort of tough, I've been typing my whole life, so it only takes me a few hours to get up to pace, but for some people, the learning curve can last a few days. I recommend you use this with your work or home computer whenever accuracy and speed aren't really an issue, and bust out your old keyboard or another replacement if you really need to type fast. If you can touch type, it'll only take a few hours to get used to it!

*It's also has a large footprint, I use a large desk so it's not a problem, but for those of you who may have a space premium, consider something smaller or be prepared to move some stuff around.

CONCLUSION

All in all, I really love this keyboard, it relived the pain in my wrists and arms and has a ton of convenient features, Microsoft has been making these things for years, and there's a reason why, they work and people love them! I'm just a drop in the bucket with all of these reviews, so I highly recommend that you read everything and try it out!",An amazing keyboard for cheap!,1437436800,

The padding at the bottom is not really padding so much as a leathery material over plastic, which I didn't actually mind but was just surprised by. The space bar is also too stiff for my liking, especially for the gaming that I use this for. It does not come with any sort of manual so figuring out how to set the special function keys was a bit confusing and took a bit of Google searching to figure out. I learned that you have to download device specific software to assign the keys, which can be found here: https://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/d/natural-ergonomic-keyboard-4000 . But in regards to typing, personally I had not used a keyboard anything like this before. I had always used laptop keyboards and those iMac bluetooth keyboards. So I'm not really a connoisseur per-say of this kind of keyboard, but to me it was a welcome change and I thoroughly enjoyed using it. I still maintained my 70WPM typing speed, and even was a little faster than usual (granted after I got used to the keyboard about a day later). So all in all great keyboard, except for the lack of manual or instructions of any kind whatsoever.

Throughout all of his years of trying out different keyboards, this is the only one he has found that works for him. He started using this one while in college and, a number of years later, this is still the keyboard that best suits his needs and he continues to replace his old worn-out keyboards with a brand-new keyboard of the same model. He even uses this keyboard at work all day. The ergonomic keyboard is great because it allows you to naturally rest your wrists to type versus a standard keyboard that makes you keep your wrists fairly straight. My husband has very broad shoulders and this keyboard lets him spend hours a day on his computer without giving him wrist pain. The bottom portion of the keyboard is a soft padded material which is very comfortable. This is also a very durable keyboard even with our twin toddlers occasionally banging on it! Each of his keyboards has lasted approximately four years and he is very happy with its longevity and the price he pays for them.

I gave it 4 stars, because of the space bar thing (which I fixed myself, no big deal) and the character/numbers are wearing off so fast. It ain't compact that's for sure!

Recently,  I spilled some coffee on my keyboard and had to use one of those little chicklett keyboards that comes free with a computer/laptop keyboard... we have it around to use as a backup in these cases. I waited a good week to let my keyboard dry out and I never had such a bad time trying to type on that little keyboard. It's smaller than normal size and usually I adjust, but I just couldn't this time. I am average sized female and I need a normal sized keyboard.

When I first got my MS Natural Ergonomic 4000 it took some getting used to, but not very long...... I can type for hours, faster, without feeling any pain or fatigue what-so-ever.
The ONLY problem I have is the key characters/numbers are wearing off. I've had other keyboards for over 10 years and the letters/numbers never wore off even with regular cleaning with alcohol.  I remedied that by making my own stick-ons with double sided tape, clear packing tape, and printing out the letter in white on black background.

I lamented over the fact that it doesn't have mechanical switches.

The keys feel pretty good with the right amount of travel. The layout is comfortable. There are a few keystroke combinations that I do that are more difficult due to the large space in the middle. That just takes some getting used to.

I am a nerd and really like the dedicated calculator key. The volume controls are a must have for me on any keyboard. The rest of the dedicated hard keys and shortcuts really mean nothing to me. I thought right away that they would be handy, but I find myself never using them. The software allows you to remap these to just about anything.

I normally rate this keyboard 5 stars but the particular model I got sucks, the one I got is the cheaper model.
Pros;
This keyboard has the Ergo 4000 standard layout and spacing.
In my experience the keyboards last for many years.

Cons:
With this particular model, the keys have a satin finish, small ugly letters and the touch stiff but feels mushy,. Not crisp as I'm used to.

---
It is my understanding there are at least two models of this keyboard, This is the is model I didn't want.
Fixing the cords is easy I just didn't have time.
For cable strain relief I loop the cord and duck tap it to the bottom of the kb to eliminate flexing at the keyboard edge which is where the wires eventually break.

Other thoughts.
I work in the dark a lot. Wish MS would listen to the demands by long time Ergo 4000 users to bring back the Ivory color.

I write for a living, and I can spend hours at the keyboard.  Normal keyboards cause my hands to tire out during marathon writing sessions, and I have had recurring problems with my wrists (carpal tunnel syndrome).
The split in the middle enables me to hold my hands at their natural angle, rather than having to slightly bend the wrists outwards.  The padded wrist rest along with the detachable lift that raises the wrist portion of the keyboard enables me to rest my wrists even as I type.  I now have no problem typing for extended periods.

The keys have become softer. I don't remember a ""break-in"" period on my previous 4000, so only thing I can think of is that they've changed the key mechanisms. This reminds me a little bit of when IBM started moving away from the model Ms. There's more resistance on the keys of my first 4000 after 10 years than after this new one that I'm typing on now.

It is the first time I have used an ergonomic split keyboard.  I am a medical transcriptionist and type for a living.  At first I found it awkward, I kept reaching too far for some keys, and it seemed that I was always missing the right-sided home row by one key.  Now I find that I'm not thinking about the keyboard at all, which means it is working well for me.  I find the key ""touch"" to be a little on the firm side, which means that I occasionally miss a letter because I didn't push hard enough, but I think over time I will adjust to that, too.  This keyboard does not ""click"" when you type, which means it is generally quiet.  Personally, I prefer the clicking, but for work, I wear a headset and don't hear the keyboard at all, so this is not an issue.  Of course, with the need to press the keys harder, there is more thumping than I think I would normally hear when I type.  As far as the alignment, it seems excellent.  I have rheumatoid arthritis, which is well controlled, but I still have some stiffness and loss of range of motion in my fingers and wrists, and the angles of the keyboard seem to be perfect for me, and I don't feel as much strain as I used to in my wrists after working all day.  There is one thing I wish was included, and that is a lighted keyboard.  I have never had one, but I have worn the letters off the keys of several keyboards, plus it would just be helpful to be able to see the keys more easily for those times when you don't have bright light or so your eyes don't have to adjust to dim lighting after staring at your bright monitor screen for a long period of time.  After less than two weeks, I can already see shiny spots on the space bar and some of the most-used keys, so I know the letters will start wearing off soon.  Not a big deal, but a lighted keyboard would be a really nice feature, perhaps an option that could be offered in the future.  If you are considering this type of keyboard, I think it is worth the minor aggravation of needing some time to get used to it.  My impression is that my hands and wrists will be thankful I made this purchase.  UPDATE JULY 22, 2015:  The keyboard started acting strangely yesterday morning, some keys not working at all, some keys creating the wrong letter or digit, and the period key seemed to be stuck.  I tried to file a claim using the extended warranty, but because it was still under the manufacturer's warranty, they told me to contact Microsoft, and they gave me the wrong phone number for Microsoft.  Microsoft wanted the keyboard to be shipped back to them in California, and they would send a replacement AFTER they received this one.  I use the keyboard for work, and I don't have a week or more to wait for a replacement.  I asked for my money back, which they agreed to do, BUT they then sent me on a wild goose chase trying to make that happen.  It seemed that no one with Microsoft had any idea of how to help me and they didn't seem interested at all in helping me, although one person I spoke to at one of the wrong numbers I was given was very kind and helpful in spite of my anger and frustration (thanks, Sachin!), but he couldn't help me either, and he said I needed to contact Amazon.  This was definitely NOT Amazon's problem, but you know what?  They made it right.  No arguments, no questions, no lengthy explanations, no making me feel like I was trying to take advantage of them.  I asked for their help, and they apologized for the troubles I had experienced and sent a new keyboard.  I have heard people complain about Amazon, but as far as I'm concerned, they are AWESOME.  Microsoft and Square Trade Warranties not so much.  This keyboard should have lasted longer than a few months, and Microsoft's customer service was horrible when I needed help, so when I have to purchase another keyboard, I probably won't buy another Microsoft product.

One thing I don't care for is that Microsoft changed the rightside 'Windows key' to a 'context key'.  I can see where that would benefit some, but I'd prefer to be able to assign the ""win-key' function to the right-side, as I'd use that side w/ the ""Ctrl + Win-key"" shortcut much more than the leftside ""Win-key"".  I may be able to reassign that, as there is some customizable function available, but I haven't really looked into it yet.
[Comments w/ 'advise' always appreciated.;)]
Its been nice to lose the 'sticking keys' problem, but I may have to lower my desk an inch or two, because the riser & my 'adjustment' now have my hands about an inch & a half higher than before.  That seems to be the biggest difference, & one that I'll likely have to compensate for.  As soon as I can get a 'roundtoit'.
It would 'prolly be a good idea for most of us to reassess our personal ergonomic space on a regular basis, but again, I'll need a 'roundtoit'.

However the honeymoon phase was exactly that... and my keyboard soon died, one key at a time.  After a couple of months of use (up to 8 hours a day, 5 days a week).  By the time I couldn't handle it anymore, 13 keys were down for the count: C, I, O, U, Y, Z, the main ENTER key, the  key, /, *, -, Insert, and Delete.  Needless to say, the inability to use these keys made this keyboard useless.

Hoping that there may be a debris under the keys issue - I cleaned it out.  Since I had only had the keyboard a couple months, there was nothing to be cleaned out.  I deleted and re-installed the keyboard and intellitype pro drivers, and it still didn't help.  I tried other USB ports, on my computer and several other computers... still didn't work.

It takes some getting used to but once your muscle memory gets re-wired to the slight differences in key size and placement, it's great.  I'm very glad I went with this one instead of their newest one which I was considering.  It is less expensive and I think more practical from a software development perspective.  Two things I wish they had done better though - the enter key is a bit too small and that zooming dealie would be much more useful as a scroll wheel.  As luck would have it, for a project I'm working on it makes a great dedicated zoom tool.  It is useful occasionally for zooming in and out with Firefox but that's all I've really used it for beyond my own custom software.  It came with the incline already installed so I decided to try using it like that although I haven't used it that way in the past.  Trust me leave it on.  Once you get used to it it's more comfortable.  One other note - this keyboard is pretty big.  Probably the biggest I've ever had, but big for a reason.  I have larger sized hands and could see someone with small hands having some issues stretching say from the home position to the control keys.  In the past they've had the cross layout for the cursor keys that I really disliked.  They've corrected that with the more intuitive inverted 'T' layout.  For me - a person with larger hands that develops software - it's the best comfiest keyboard available.

However, when I first got it, I had some trouble. I've never typed on an ergonomic keyboard before. I usually get a typing speed of around 80-90WPM, but my speed fell to about 40 when I first plugged it in. I went to typeracer.com, and slowly built my speed back up. It's just one of those ""You'll have to get used to it"" kind of ordeals. I should mention if you use the numpad during gaming, namely first person shooters, I always set it to 0/ins is sprint, and + is jump. This keyboard seems to have a ghosting issue, meaning if you're holding down sprint, and want to jump, the jump key isn't going to respond, you have to release sprint then QUICKLY press jump. Annoying as hell, but I've had keyboards in the past that did this. I should have expected it honestly. Now, this keyboard does have other keys, as you can see. Home, search, e-mail, favorites, mute, vol down, vol up, play/pause, calculator, back, forward, and zoom. Personally, I disabled the zoom key, I found it annoying. The favorites keys you can assign to open a web page, file, or program, using the Microsoft mouse and keyboard center (if you're connected to the internet, as soon as you plug this keyboard in, it will automatically download that software from Windows Update). The F keys also double as various commands. I personally just keep that turned off, so when I press ALT + F4, it'll close the window instead of opening a new one (F4 on this keyboard is ""new""). F2 and F3 are undo and redo, but you can also use CTRL + Z, and CTRL + Y, respectfully, so I remapped those to previous song/next song :) above the numpad, you also have additional keys, equals, left parenthesis, right parenthesis, and less than. Since I use this keyboard for personal use, and not professional use, I haven't touched those keys. It has the usual two prongs near the top to prop it up, but it also comes with a base, to prop it up from the back, instead of just the front. The rubber strips make this keyboard quite comfortable to type on, and with the stand and prongs, it's elevated height make it even better for me. If you want to type comfortably, and have time to adjust and get your speed back up first, then I recommend this.","Looks weird, feels great...wait?",1419120000,

This is a fantastic keyboard. I use this keyboard for about 8 hours a day at work and I thoroughly enjoy it. For any software devs looking at this board: buy it; it is great for software development and I don't know a dev that wouldn't recommend it.

That being said, I was very hesitant of the split design at first, but my wrists were hurting and I was desperate. The transition from regular keyboard to this is somewhat difficult, but after about 2 weeks I found that I could type better on this than a regular keyboard. The front and back can be raised and lowered so you can find the correct position for your wrists (they should not be bent). I used to find myself taking pain relievers after work due to my wrists, but they are no longer an issue thanks to this keyboard. I did not switch desks, chairs, mice, or my posture, so I am fairly confident that some feature of the keyboard is what relieved the pain.

The only issues I have seen is that the keyboard does wear out over time. The letters get worn off and the typing gets very ""clackey"". I was previously using a friends old keyboard (same model), which had lived through 3 years of hard use. The keyboard software is iffy, I could never get the hotkeys to work, but I have seen it working perfectly on other computers. I would probably give this product a 4/5 stars if it weren't the best damn ergonomic keyboard on the market right now, it has no competitors that come close.",Best Ergo-Board as of Late 2014,1418860800,

3 major complaints:
1 - No F keys visible. Doing a lot of web designing using WordPress, the F5 refresh key is used frequently. Of course a programmable board such this has an F-Lock key, but that means engaging the lock before the Function keys can perform normally. Then, they aren't even labeled. It is a case of user-friendly overkill. Instead of F1, F2, etc. we have Help, Undo, Redo, New, Open, and so forth.
2 - This has to have the noisiest space bar I've ever heard. It has a metallic click on both press and release. And the bar, having to stretch wider than normal, tends to tilt unless tapped very near center.
3 - The right Shift Lock is a huge stretch from the normal right hand rest position. The left side is ok but the right side from the ""Y"" to the Shift Lock is uncomfortably far away.

CON: The end where the cable attaches to the keyboard is very flimsy. Many other keyboards have a rubber neck at that point for added support.
CON: I usually keep 2 or 3 spare keyboards because they're very sensitive to liquid. I doubt they're using water-soluble circuit pens to make the circuits, but I've had several stop working. The keyboard covers for them interfere a lot with typing, so I don't use them.
SUMMARY: Being able to type for hours outweighs the inconvenience of having to keep spare keyboards on hand.

I rarely move my keyboard more than a few inches now & then so wireless/Bluetooth is not really needed. The wire is attached to the keyboard (can't be removed) and is about 5' long. Fortunately, my monitor has 2 USB ports - because my computer is behind me and would require about 10' cord (you can always get a USB extension if needed).

I don't find the keys to be noisy. There is a slight click when pushed - which I like. I work at home, alone... so any keyboard noise is irrelevant to me. But even in an office situation, I doubt this keyboard is any louder than most other alternatives.

For the money - got it on sale - this is a great keyboard. Has ""favorite"" keys which I haven't programmed yet, and other features I haven't used... my typos have decreased significantly, and I really like the feel of the keys.

In the area between the two keyboards is a little button that if you push it up it will zoom in on your web page, push it down it will zoom out. I wish it would go to 100% if pushed down... but there is a little box that pops up showing the zoom %. Very handy when viewing small text or videos in websites that won't let you resize.

The Home key is in the middle of the 6 keys top right - to the right of the Insert key. The End key is in middle bottom row just under the Home key. The Page Up and Page Down keys are on far right of the group of 6. Delete is below the Insert key. The Home & End keys are in different location than my Logitech board, at first I thought it awkward, but now find it as a better layout.

The volume up, down, mute buttons are silver and on top row on right end. They are well spaced so mute is easy to find and volume up/down are right next to each other for easy volume control. The video/audio play/pause button is to the right of the sound buttons. I found this button does not always work - depending what you are watching.

The F keys have multi-functions, I rarely, if ever use them for the alternate function - such as Undo, Redo, Close, Send, Spell, Save, etc.... I'm too used to keyboard shortcuts ctrl+c copy, ctrl+v paste, ctrl+z undo, ctrl+s save, ctrl+x cut, etc... no need to move my hand to find the right F key.

Cap Lock - at first I was disappointed that it did not make a beep when selected like my Logitech board which had one tone for on, one for off.... instead the MS board has 4 lights in the silver area center bottom of board. The top like is green when there is power on. The 2nd light lights up when Caps Lock is pushed on and goes off when Caps are off. Actually like it better than the sounds. The sounds were nice to alert you that you accidentally hit the Caps key not the Tabs key... but was harder to remember if Caps were on or off... the light makes that easier.

There is a forward/back arrows on the front center silver area above the lights... could be nice when browsing on the web. I tried them and they work fine... I use a Logitech Revolution wireless mouse that has fwd/back buttons on the side of the mouse. So I don't use the keyboard.

Number Keys are standard... but just above them are 4 keys which if you get used to using could save time:  =  (  )  <

I got a Microsoft Natural Keyboard to try to help the problem. That was 16 years ago, and I still use that keyboard at home today. The handrests, space bar and several frequently used keys are all worn smooth, but it still works as well as the day I got it.

I started having the same issues again, and realized it was my keyboard at work. I bought this keyboard to use at work, and the problems immediately went away. This new keyboard is a vast improvement over my 16-year-old version. The handrests are a soft neoprene type substance. The keys are very easy to work with, and there are a ton of extra buttons that can be assigned to do whatever you want: bring up a calculator, open your email, and so on. There is also a zoom wheel that performs different functions depending on the application you're in.

I adapted to this new layout instantly, people not familiar with using a split keyboard may take a little while longer to get used to it. My only complaint is that the space bar is a bit stiffer than I would like - for the first few days I kept missing spaces because I wasn't hitting it hard enough.

This has proven to be the most comfortable one so far. I had one of these at my last job and I ended up buying one for my current job and for home.

I recommend buying the business version (this keyboard is also available in the home edition.) While a little more expensive, the business version comes with a small stand that can be removed to make the angle of the keyboard change. The home version does not come with this stand. Because of this, the angle for the home version cannot be changed and you are basically forced to use the keyboard in only two positions in opposite to four as it is the case with the business version.

People who hit the keys very strongly (as if using a typewriter), may find this keyboard not as strong. However, for someone who does hit keys very hard like me (I learned to type on a very old Remington typewriter), I have already put about three of these keyboards to the test and all the keys have survived me.

I would also definitely recommend this keyboard for anybody who is suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome or any other sort of pain around the wrist area. The support for the wrists is pretty large. I had keyboard-used tendonities and first stages of carpal tunnel and that's the reason why I had to switch to natural and ergonomic keyboards long time ago. This keyboard has definitely helped me and I'm no longer in pain when typing. Of course, everybody is different and your results may not be the same as mine.

ok - it was not expensive, but when getting a keyboard to be used 10+ hours pr day, the cost is not the most important - but rather the quality of it.. Is it made by Toys'rUS? It feels like a toy, and act like a toy.

For anyone who looks for a good keyboard, keep looking - This is not what you look for. The keys are ""flappy"", the spacebar wobbely and not sure if it even have a stabilizer. Sometimes the the keyboard sends things on its own, which can be bad when you have carefully selected text/files, and suddenly the selection goes away. Double work, and not very business friendly.

I have been using a Microsoft Natural Elite keyboard for many years, which felt like a PRO version compared to this one.

The config software does not allow to configure all keys either, but yes, by manually editing the config files you can control every key,.. that is - until random refreshes the software seems to do, which resets any modifications you might have done and you have to do it all over again.

But, the Ergonomic 4000 is a huge piece of hardware, and perhaps can be used to knock intruders in your home.

Microsoft: WHY did you stop making Quality hardware?  The same goes for the Trackball Explorer, the best trackball there was, then it was discontinued., Hardware is obviously something you don't know how to do, so leave that to the professionals.

If you are looking for quality keyboards, there are quite a few to choose from, WASD, DAS Keyboard and many others. They are on the opposite side of the scale, they produce Quality, not Toys.",Very disappointed!,1414368000,

They pretty much become useless once something from the outside touches them.  in contrast the cheap version of this keyboard has a tray under the keys that keep almost everything out and separated from the internals.

Since I spend at least 9-10 hours per day at a keyboard, I quickly decided I wanted to get something that would not contribute to this problem. I'm pretty hard on my wrists between having a desk job, playing drums, and riding my motorcycle, and I want them to last my whole life.

After reviewing options online and talking to a coworker who had the Microsoft 4000, I decided to buy it. I've used it for a few weeks now and want to get a second one for home use. I really love it - so much so that I'm annoyed by using my laptop keyboard when I'm in meetings.

The split design takes very little time to adjust to, and the slope of the keys away from my body feels very natural (you can also remove the riser in the front so the keyboard lays flat). As some other reviewers noted, the space bar does tend to be a bit stiff, but once you get used to the key weight you'll find very little trouble typing what you intended. I love the way the wrist rest feels too!

When I was looking around, my main hesitations were that the keyboard wasn't wireless (I really wanted a Logitech wireless keyboard to pair with the tiny receiver on my Logitech mouse), and I also would have liked to see backlit keys, especially on a wired keyboard. In the end, these would be nice improvements for the next generation of this keyboard, but their lack doesn't bother me enough to offset a star.",Makes quite a difference on my wrists.,1413504000,

For context, I spend most of my time at a keyboard, at work and at home. I type fast, I key too hard, and I spend 4-6 hours a day typing (not sitting at a computeractively typing). My first two MS 4000 keyboards lasted 3-4 years each under that abuse. They were my first ergonomic keyboards and I loved them. The many other reviews on this product do a good job of explaining the pros and cons. This keyboard has worked so well for me that I've replaced it with the same keyboard every time. I buy them at work so I can use them there, too. When I've been responsible for ordering keyboards for others, this is the one I get.

However, starting three or four years ago, I noticed that the keyboards weren't lasting as long. The physical action of the keys was fine, but something would go wrong with the underlying membrane, or the electronics. A key would stop working, or key mappings would get strangely scrambledone keyboard started outputting two letters per key press, but only for half the letters and none of the numbers. This would happen within 12-18 months of purchasing the keyboard.

My last two keyboards have died within 8-12 months.

This is pretty annoying, but for the low price, it's still worth it for me to buy a new one when the old ones die.

The Review pertains specially to using it with a Mac.

After about 3 weeks use, the keys a, s, d, & e no longer show their names;  letter labels have worn off.

No manual came with the keyboard, which requires programming, though you may be able to find how to program it by searching the internet and trying to find a manual on line.  Then you need to download a driver for the keyboard.

In many ways this is a dream keyboard after you get it programmed.  It has about 15 special keys that need programming.  These are a great convenience.  After downloading the driver, you go to the Mac System Preferences.  In the bottom row an icon is now present for this Keyboard.  Having entered that icon, you may program the special keys, most of those keys having a menu of assignable choices. Generally, once you are in the MS Keyboard icon, if you press a programmable key, a menu pops up of alternative assignments from which you choose.

Also, I love having the split, contoured, ergonomic keyboard -- it should discourage carpal tunnel syndrome.

I have my keys assigned for
scroll/jump down,
language change (to Greek or English),
open default browser,
open Word,
eject,
Site 1 = a forum,
Site 2 = hotmail,
Site 3 = another forum
Site 4 = YouTube,
Site 5 = Amazon !
(5 keys are to program 5 favorite websites.)
mute,
volume up,
volume down,
 iTunes next track,
dashboard.

In the center of the main keyboard there is a rocker switch which zooms in & out what you are seeing on many screens, like the internet.

The split keyboard is great for typing in low light for a touch-typist.  Once you get your hands in the right place (easy to do) you can do a lot of typing without light.

Drawbacks for me:

1) letters wear off,

2) not wireless.

3) there are no scroll wheel, trackball, or mouse buttons on the keyboard.

I can scroll down using a programmed key, but not up (actually it is an incremental jump down, requiring about 5 pushes to make a whole screen go down).

BTW, IOGear makes a smaller keyboard that is very convenient keyboard that has mouse buttons, trackball, & scroll all built in & is wireless -- but my hands get lost on the keyboard in the dark, its keys are closer than I want, and the built-in trackball & scroll function quit working soon.  I have owned something like10 of the IOGear keyboards, and all have gone bad in about 3 months.

3) Some genius years ago decided to put the number 6 on the left side, where it does not belong for touch-typists. The number 6 is supposed to be operated by the right index finger in touch-typing.  But it is now divided off to the left.

4) It is too wide for my use.  I like to type in my lap sitting back from a very large monitor screen. This keyboard is so wide that it does not fit between the arms of my easy chair, and if I center the keyboard for typing, it then sticks out way to the right.  I don't need the keypad on the right.  It makes the keyboard too wide for me.  I intend to try surgery; cutting off the right side number pad.

Thus for my use Microsoft should produce this keyboard with
no number pad, thus not so wide,
key letters that don't wear off,
wireless,
built in mouse keys,
built in trackball,
built in scroll wheel,
number 6 on the right side

The first one lasted 7 years and was priced around the same as this one if I remember correctly. Chose this over others as this is truly Ergonomic. I have the logitech wireless version and there was still a slight strain on my wrists that I don't have using this keyboard.
 This one is a bit lighter in weight than our older version, that's okay but it will allow it to slide easier. I just used some rubber matting underneath which keeps it stationary.
 I use the ""wired"" version as wireless is not necessary with my needs. This is used on a laptop and is plug into the USB hub and had no issue at all.
 I've worked in graphic design for years and the amount of typing is MUCH easier with these keyboards. I use the stylus mainly but these are still fantastic compared to straight keyboards. The only issue is the ""cushioned"" hand rest could have been thicker but I cut out some rubber foam from padding in the exact shape of the handrests to adhere on top and that works out great for additional comfort as well to raise your wrists up a bit higher.

So I need a keyboard with the proper feel.  The keys need to have what I call ""snapback"", meaning the action is crisp, with an elasticity which means the keys aren't mushy and they jump back with a ""snap"" after being depressed.  The ergonomic aspect of this keyboard is beautiful.  I can't properly use a regular keyboard - it hurts my wrists and causes me to create more typos.  On average, an ergonomic keyboard helps me create about 25% less typos (I type very fast).

The hot-button keys are still archaic, but elegant if you go for those things.  The ""Zoom"" button in the middle of the board can be extremely useful.  The hand-rest is one of the best ones out there for any keyboard.  The board itself is perfectly balanced and tilted.  The legs that you extend out of the bottom are pretty worthless so be prepared when they break.

Someday we will see clear keys on keyboards, all of which are programmable.  We will see a scrolling wheel (already has appeared actually) which allows us to combine our F-function keys with our number keys and out hot-button keys all into one row of keys, which have menus we can scroll through.  But for now, we have this old style board, and for the money, the MS 4000 is the best one out there.  The only other keyboard with a feel as good as this is from Logitech, but it is priced too high.

This is the fourth 4000 I've had.  The letters on the keys are already wearing off and I'll go through the same routine I always do: test all the new keyboards, read about all of the others I can't test because CompUSA went out of business, and then go buy another 4000 to replace my old one.","One of the best, and super cheap!",1402099200,

1. Google how to change the zoom slider to a scroll slider (it IS possible and actually pretty easy)-unless you are a graphic designer, you will thank me later.
 2. This will keep your coworkers from throwing you, and the keyboard out the nearest window...
CAREFULLY pry off the space bar, you will find two identical sets of paired posts with holes on each side of the space where the key was, the bottom hole is where the guide pin goes, the top is just for stability of the space bar when you press it down. THIS is the post you need to focus on, grab a very thin piece of rubber (about 1mm thick) and cut a small circle just enough to cover the whole and glue it on top to act as a damper. The space bar is the only key on the board that makes a definite tapping sound when you press it. All the other keys are dampened enough by the membrane underneath. Do this small thing and you will have a very quiet keyboard and happy coworkers. If you don't do this then remember that the keyboard is pretty wide and solid and makes an excellent sound when your coworker picks it up and smacks you across the head with it.

Although the layout is something that not everybody would like, but I do find it actually helping with my touch typing since now I don't have the tendency of hitting the keys with the wrong hand. It has plenty of extra keys that can be used to bind to useful commands including media control (it is really noisy in our office so can't concentrate properly without music).
My biggest problem though (the reason that I subbed 2 stars) is the lack of configuration. The only way to access the extra keys is through the microsoft keyboard and mouse center which is a really limited utility and also the fact that the knob in the middle is set to ""zoom"". From their utility you have only 2 options - ""zoom"" or nothing. (btw ""zoom"" is just ctrl+scroll) And it is impossible to make it scroll (a much more useful function in my opinion) without hacking through the configuration xml files and even after doing so - one of updates just reseted everything so I'm back to ""zoom"" and I can't use a different hotkey manager to control that, since only the microsoft utility can work with these extra keys.
P.S.: same thing goes for the ""favorites"" button and the whole ""Fn"" thing (why is it a toggle?! I would be perfectly fine if it was a shift button)

I personally type hard and like the feel of the keys.  Some reviews mentioned that the space bar is loud. I definitely agree with that remark.  The space bar is the loudest key on the keyboard but I think it has to do with the fact that the space bar sits on the curve center portion of the keyboard.  It is the only key in that positon.  Overall, for the price, you can't beat the quality of the keyboard.  It is a Microsoft product and worth the money.  Do I wish the space bar wasn't so loud?  YES, but at the same time my job doesn't require me to type all day long.  I type in short spurts so the space bar isn't a deal breaker to me.  If your job requires you to constantly enter text or data, you may want to considered another keyboard but I would sugget that you test drive the keyboard in a store before purchasing.",Keyboard works great,1395187200,

It's nice

Cons
It takes up a lot of space. A ridiculous amount.
The keys wear out quickly. I've had mine for 6 months and the A, S, and E keys are all black now.
I use the extra features rarely, if ever. The scroll wheel in the middle seems to work for zooming but not scrolling.
The scroll lock is off by default. No biggie. Except every time you fire up and use Excel you have to turn it on.

I've always used Microsoft keyboards but it's time to switch. They have just gotten of lower quality over the years. And I have to get a new one at least every year.

I've been using the ""Natural Keyboard Elite"" (white, PS/2 connector) at work and home/office for over 10 years. A bottle of Snapple Peach Tea (my favorite) was spilled on my home keyboard recently. Immediate shaking and blotting did not save it and the next day, several of the keys were obviously hard to push and slow to retract (""gummed up"" is the technical term I think). I've ""washed"" keyboards before (by hand and via dishwasher) with mixed results and before I chanced anything with this keyboard, I looked for a new one. Of course Microsoft doesn't make the ""Elite"" anymore and this keyboard (the ""Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000"") was the closest I could find, so I ordered it for next day delivery.

I don't consider myself a keyboard snob, but I guess I am, as so much about this keyboard bothers me. I guess I'll start with the positives though.

Pros:
* Split/humped design is good for your hands/wrists and possibly other joints and spine (plus other people will be dissuaded from trying to use your computer)
* Real full-throw keys, not chicklets or membrains (though lower profile than the old ""Elite"" keys)
* Wired (no batteries to replace or radio signals to intercept or jam)
* Soft wrist pad is comfy
* Extra buttons/scroll/zoom/app controls can be convenient
* Full-size pyramid-style dedicated arrow keys (unlike the smaller 'T' layout on the ""Elite"")
* The num pad is perfectly normal except for unnecessary ""rounding"" of the keys
* The additional mathmatical/algebraic keys above the num pad are cool, but (3 of them) require special MSFT software to enable - spreadsheet ""programmers"" probably really like these (=, (, ), and backspace)

Cons:
* Keys are ""mushy"", especially the space bar - this is my biggest gripe with this keyboard
* Space bar has a weird initial resistence to press and after exerting sufifcient force, makes a very audible ""plunk"" sound as the key reaches the floor - this happens with either the left or right thumb/side of the space bar (or dead-center press)
- Every other key is extremeliy quiet, onliy the space bar provides the periodic annoying ""plunk""
* Keys are asymetrical (e.g. the 'N' key is about 3-times wider than the 'M' key, '7' is at least twice as wide as '8' and '6' is smaller than any normal key) - if you're a touch typist, these don't matter so much but the keyboard occasionally feels very strange when I feel the edges of keys that are completely foreign to me
* Function keys are about 2/3 size (similar to the ""Elite"", but rounded) and have that stupid ""[F] Lock"" thing
* USB only (hey, some of us like to use our USB ports for other stuff and that PS/2 port is just going to waste)
* No USB hub functionality (as long as it's going to eat a USB port on my system, give me another port to plug my mouse or other HID into)
* Keyboard is about 4"" deeper than the old ""Elite"" model - this thing's a beast

So I've ""washed"" my Elite and blown it out with an air compressor. Hopefully that'll return it to the previous state and I can stop using this black beast (I do prefer the color though).

If you love this keyboard, more power to you, it's just not for me (or my fingers, or my ears)!

It has a very ergonomic design overall. I found it a bit amusing that it had a warning label on it talking about things like carpal tunnel and other muscular disorders etc. There is a reason this sticker is there, it is because the space bar on this thing is so far beyond bad that if you use this for more than a few hours you will get carpal tunnel. Keep in mind that the space bar is quite possibly the most commonly used key!

If you look around the internet you will see people trying to fix this things space bar. Just do a quick search. If you are the type of person that wants to pry off the space bar on a brand new keyboard by all means go for it, this is the perfect product for you. As for me, I feel at the price of this product the whole thing should be amazing.

Who would I recommend this to? People who want carpal tunnel surgery.

For a better solution see also the Perixx PERIBOARD ergonomic model. It has a split space bar that you won't have to fix and is simply amazing.

It has 2 flaws:

1) The letters/numbers rub off the keys, and relatively quickly. This will make the keyboard unusable for those who 'hunt & peck'. But if you type from key memory, it's not really much of an issue.

2) And this is the BIG flaw... It's more sensitive to moisture than any other piece of electronics I've ever owned. Anyone who's used computers for a long time has at some point dumped a full cup of something onto their keyboard. I've done it more often than I care to admit. Other keyboards I've owned were surprisingly forgiving about this kind of thing, and usually go back to working ok once they dry out. In contrast: The MS4000 keyboard will be completely bricked if you get even a few drops of moisture between the keys. And I mean anywhere, between any of the keys, the whole keyboard is kind of a timebomb waiting for a few drops of moisture to commit sepuku with. Considering how a keyboard is made, you'd almost have to deliberately try to make something as sensitive to moisture as the ms4000.

This assessment is based on owning 3 (three) ms4000 keyboards over the past 7 years. I'm currently typing on a $10 logitech entry level keyboard which is no where near as comfortable to use. I'd much rather be typing on an ms4000, but I'm getting really sick of the built-in obsolescence in them. Toying with the idea of rearranging my desk area to allow a completely separate surface for drinks... but I'm kind of irked at MS for making the ms4000 so sensitive to moisture touching it in any way, that it almost has to be deliberate.

I spend 10+ hours a day in front of a computer. After YEARS of use, they are old, discolored, and grimy. After my coworkers commented on how grimy they are, I finally decided to purchase this keyboard as a replacement.

I prefer the key layout that features the 2x3 Insert/Home/Delete/End keypad and the mostly horizontal arrow keys. Several manufacturers of other natural keyboards like to stack these keys up. I'm happy to say the original key layout is used on this keyboard (which you can see in the pictures).

The key press on this keyboard is much quieter than the MS Natural Pro was, but the key presses are still authoritative and confident. The note has moved from a ""clickety-clack"" to more of a low ""thunk."" If you're on a solid desk, it makes nearly no noise at all. One of my desks is a bar-height wall mount, so the thunk is a little louder there, but this is in no way a show stopper. The space bar is the loudest key.

I've read a lot of other reviews about the space bar being hard to press. Initially, I definitely noticed a slight difference. After a day's use, either the space bar has ""broken in,"" or I simply don't notice it any more. Again, not a show stopper.

If you're transitioning from a ""normal"" keyboard to a ""natural"" one, I highly encourage it. It will take a few days to adjust to the new layout, but it is much easier on your wrists and hands (must try it to believe it).

I started stretching once a day and got this keyboard and the Innovera Gel Mouse Pad with Wrist Rest, and the pain has since completely gone away.  I don't even need to stretch anymore.

The raised front is weird at first, but I was completely used to it and the split keyboard after about 1 week.

It should be noted that when mine first arrived it had a weird behavior that whenever i'd hit the spacebar not exactly in the middle (95% of the time), it would hit the alt button on the right side.  This went away after about 2 weeks of use.  Could probably take a nail file and file the front right corner of the spacebar where it was hitting the alt key and save yourself the week of aggravation.  That's what I'll do next time - didn't want to this time in case I returned it.

I have my laptop up about 5"" so this can fit under it, so the volume keys on the keyboard are a welcome addition.  The calculator button gets a lot of use as well.

Other Con is the stupid F Lock key.  I'm not sure why it's there, or why it's so close to the oft-used ""prtscn"" button.  I hit it and none of the Function keys work right until I realize what I'd done.

The general design is nice. I'm a fan of the concept of including some tilt and splitting the keys to make it possible to hold your hands in a fairly relaxed position. The physical build of the keyboard itself just didn't seem to be quite up to par with the price. I've been using the one I have now for several months and the space bar has never really felt great. I got used to it and I adjust for it now, but it's just now quite as easy to press down smoothly as the ones I've had on other keyboards. It feels like it has too much wiggle room.

At its current prices, though, it's not hugely more expensive than the really rock bottom cheap keyboards that don't have any ergonomic features. If you're doing an awful lot of typing (which happens to me at times) this is definitely worth it.

A big downside you should note is that this thing is pretty darn big. It's a full-sized keyboard with the number pad to the side, plus extra height and width added for the ergonomic features. If you have your keyboard tray in a tight space or very limited room on your desk, that might be an issue.

This also has a bunch of smart feature keys, but honestly their responsiveness seems to vary. The ones that pop open windows do great, but the volume keys are often very slow to do anything (on a Win 7 computer). I truly don't know if it's interference with something else installed on my machine, or if it's just something about how the keyboard drivers get along with Win 7. I've basically just given up on hitting those buttons.

On the whole, if you want a keyboard that has some ergonomics going for it and isn't hugely expensive (for example, if you have a history of spilling drinks on keyboards and don't want to put $100 into one) this is a good option.

If you need something wireless, or small, or you don't do much typing and don't want to adjust to a slightly modified layout (keys are in the same spots relative to each other, but that split in the middle takes a little adjustment for your muscle memory) you should look at something else.",Well Worth Its 2013-Price,1387324800,

As you probably know, the keyboard holds your hands in a much more ""natural"" position that puts less strain on your wrists. Seriously, look down and see how cramped your hands are right now. This fixes all of that.

Some major cons to this keyboard though:

- WPM went down considerably. I constantly hit the wrong keys. This is even after years of using natural keyboards
- Space bar problems persist. At other reviewers complain, the space bar sucks big time. First, it was completely stuck and wouldn't depress. I bashed it in  a few times and it loudly popped before working. It still never felt 'right' and I had many mis-types because of it.
- Questionable use of extra keys. Like that big ""throttle"" in the middle. It's only job seems to be to zoom in on images or webpages (not that useful really). I'd love to be able to customize this for video games or a certain task. Imagine being able to resize the entire window up or down with a flick or two. Or scroll through your available programs. Or flip through your inventory of items in FPS or RPG games. It just seems like a massive waste that is 0% customizable.

I still liked the product, and so did my wrists. I did try to fix it by opening it up and washing it. Let me tell you, it's a pretty complex piece of machinery for just a keyboard. You definitely are getting your money's worth.","Natural position feels ""right"", minor quirks",1387324800,

My hands are slender by my fingers are a little longer than average.  I am an excellent touch typist.  My hands are strong and agile but sometimes plagued with repetitive motion pains.

I'm a writer and editor, which means that I practically live in front of my keyboard.  The reason I started looking into ergonomic keyboards in the first place was that I was having repetitive motion problems in all of my fingers and other issues with my wrists are arms.  It was getting so bad that I pretty much couldn't type at all.

And then I got this keyboard.

Cons:
-bulkiness.  It will completely fill a normal keyboard tray, leaving no room for the mouse unless you can really squeeze it in (which I do).  But frankly, that's going to happen with any ergonomic keyboard.

Pros:
- It does what it's supposed to.  I've had the keyboard for about eight months now and can type all day without damaging my fingers.  Even when I've been having repetitive motion problems from my mouse (sigh), I can usually type without pain.  The wrist support is at exactly the right level and the way the keyboard is angled is supremely comfortable.

- It lasts (at least, so far).  After eight months, not only does the keyboard still function exactly as it ought to, I had to look closely in full sunlight to spot any wear on the keys.  In those eight months, I have typed well over a hundred thousand words.

Other comments:
- I've seen some people comment that the space bar is a little harder than on some keyboards.  Of course, to some extent, all external keyboards will have harder space bars than laptops, but it's true that this one took a little adjustment for me.  And by a little, I mean about a week.  Now, I don't notice at all.  The one time it's a problem is when one needs extreme space bar precision.  I place Guild Wars 2, in which there are jumping puzzles, and one must jump -- using the space bar -- at exact and sensitive moments.  For the most difficult of these jumping puzzles, I have to use my laptop space bar instead because I can't be exact enough with this one.",My fingers are grateful.,1387152000,

Brooks,"This keyboard is comfortable to use once you get used to it, my fingers find the home keys naturally after using it for a week or so. I removed the plastic frame in the front that put the keyboard at an unnatural angle, but if I were using a keyboard tray it would probably work better with it.  The reason for giving it only 3 stars has to do with the orientation of the number keys on top.  (Not the keyboard on the right.)  I was a statistical typist for many years on both electric typewriters and computers before the advent of the separate number keys evolved.  Consequently, I never use the number pad.

When Microsoft developed this keyboard, which was probably done by younger people who grew up learning to use the number pad, they divided the numbers incorrectly.  The number 6 should be on the top left side of the right hand but they have placed it on the top right of the left side next to the 5 and the right hand number keys start with the number 7.  This throws off not only my typing of numbers, but also the rest of the symbols over the numbers.  I suppose I will get used to this configuration after a while, but for the moment I find myself making lots of errors on numbers and things like $, @, #, etc.

If you can live with this inconvenience, this is an excellent keyboard.  The shortcut keys for favorites, home, mail, volume, etc. are quick and easy to use.

I've been using this keyboard for more than 6 years of not longer. Now it's the 2nd one, the first one was damaged by some tea flooding :) I'm a computer programmer, so a good keyboard to keep me from any wrist problem is a must.

So, the most important feature of this keyboard is the front riser! That will keep you from wrist problems.
I think many user feel it awkward and discard it right the way.
The front riser keeps your wrist flat, flat on the backside of your wrist I mean or even a naturally slightly bending down. If flat on the palm side actually you're bending your wrist upward. Bending your wrist up for long in doing work is bad, very bad.
Without the front riser, it becomes more a regular ergonomic keyboard.

It's also comfortable but you will need to adjust to this keyboard as it is VERY DIFFERENT than other keyboards you have used, especially if you use only those flat, tiny-keys, non-split keyboard.
You have to adjust to this keyboard, discard your bad posture, not the keyboard will adjust for you.

It has a design since 2005, check how many keyboard design have survived this long and have so many followers?
It's a functionally design without modern gimmicks.
My biggest complaint is the 6 key is in the wrong left location. Trained typist should knows6 should be a right hand key.

It's loud and heavy to press in modern standard, but some people prefer that for a greater feedback feel. I came from the days of using mechanical keyboards and used real typewriters when I first learn typing, so those are not problems to me.

I don't use hot keys much other than the old fashion F2 to rename file, Alt-F4 to close windows, Ctrl-C/V to cut and paste and some other Fn keys as every programmers do. So I'm not sure what the complaints of the hotkeys are about. I contrast, I do find some new keyboards have the Fn keys default to media functions very troublesome.

There is a new Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Keyboard which also have front riser that should have addressed most complaints. I haven't tried that but only the Sculpt Comfort one, the keys are lighter and quieter.",Functional great old design to protect your wrist without modern gimmicks.,1386288000,

Pressing down is not smooth or easy, in fact all the keys on the board require a degree of effort that seems against the idea of 'Ergonomic.' When resting my palms on the fat black cushion while typing there's pain, which is natural due to that's not how one should type, but the inclusion of this big fat area, below the wrists when typing, would lead one to believe that that is how one should type. I suggest having more prominent literature and illustrations with keyboard. It's been awhile since I opened the box and forgot instructions came with it. BIG and VISUALLY INSTRUCTIVE proper use is necessary. Don't use words, use pictures and drawings.

A revision should be considered. Pressing down keys should be effortless, not taxing on the fingers. The spacebar sticks, I popped it open and found a nipple of plastic, leftover from the injection mold I assume, pressing against the northern wall of the keyboard, below the center black wheel with the plus and minus on it.

That being said, it's still better to type than my previous gaming keyboard, and for 35 dollars...maybe this is what I get for quality.

The design is really nice, with the split keyboard being an increasingly rare thing to find these days. Almost no models made by anyone offer such a design, but even if there was more competition of this type, I still think this keyboard is great.

The programmable buttons (MANY of them) are a huge plus. You can program most of them to do all kinds of things, including opening often-used documents or websites for you, or running macros you write.

The buttons that are intended for specific purposes, though, are so well thought-out that I leave most of the button assignments as they are. For example, the buttons dedicated for increasing, decreasing, or muting the speaker/headphone volume are VERY useful very often. And the calculator button also gets a lot of use. Others are the same: very well-thought-out standard assignments doing things I do often (and that presumably most people do often), and once you get used to the fact that now you have a button that does what you want (at first, you'll do it the slower way requiring many more button presses &/or mouse pointer clicks), this keyboards full functionality really shines through for you, and you can't imagine how you could use anything else!

The removable palm rest is another great feature, by the way. Since I use this on my lap, and the bottom of that thing isn't comfortable at all that way, I'm very happy it comes off. And it goes on and off very quickly and easily, in case you want to move it back and forth between a non-organic surface and your lap.

The only problem I have with this keyboard in its wireless version (I have both cabled and wireless ones) is that with many positions I get in, even when the keyboard is VERY close to the receiver plugged into the USB jack on the front of my computer, it won't work at all many times. But when the keyboard is in other positions that have NO line of sight to the receiver, it works fine. It's very particular that way, with some orientations that seem like they'd make for very easy connectivity being impossible to use, while other orientations/distances that seem like they wouldn't work work just fine. Go figure. But once you learn its oddities, you can work around that by moving the keyboard and/or the receiver plugged into the computer so that it works. I do still find it annoying that it seems like the most comfortable positions I want to be in often seem impossible to make work, even with very close proximity. Using the wired version, of course, removes this problem entirely. But I think that the connectivity of the wireless version should not be so touchy and idiosyncratic, and would describe it as a ""design flaw."" I would have to say that, overall, this isn't enough to warrant deducting a star, though.

Overall, though, I'd say it's a great keyboard, and highly recommend it.","Wonderful keyboard, VERYuseful programmable buttons aplenty. Only problem: Intermittent connectivity problem with wireless unit.",1384560000,

After about one week of not-very-intense use I had to stop using this apparently well made but horribly designed keyboard.  The use of my right hand and arm became painful.  There were three main problems:

#1 The amount of thumb pressure required to actually register the ""space"" key was way too much to type with any comfort or confidence.  Even if I concentrated on always striking the space key so that a space would be inserted into the text or computer code where needed, I found that about 1-in-12 or 1-in-14 attempted spaces would not be inserted.  It is terrible that part of one's brain must focus on striking the space key with heavy force; it is even worse that one must proof read each page of text or code to ensure that spaces have been inserted where needed.

#2 The space key is intrinsically badly designed anyway, because one wants this key to be equally welcoming to both the left and right thumbs.  It isn't.  I found that my right thumb worked best, requiring unnatural contortions to ensure spaces were inserted where needed.

#3 In general, I found that the $10 keyboard Dell included with my latest XPS desktop requires a more comfortable amount of force for ALL of the keys, not just the space key.  This could be because the Microsoft Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 for Business requires greater downward movement of the keys for a stroke to be registered.

Problems #1 and #2 are so severe that I found this keyboard simply unusable.  This is quite an indictment for a way-above-average-cost keyboard that is allegedly designed and built with proper ergonomics in mind.  I am astounded that so many users find this a comfortable keyboard.  By the way, during more than half of my PC and computer keyboard use, which dates back to the late 1970s, I have actually used (and preferred) Logitech and especially Microsoft ergonomic keyboards.  This is the first ergonomic keyboard I have ever used that I have found to be a thinly disguised implement of torture for thumb, hand, and arm.

I now have some appreciation for the feelings of the other one-star and two-star reviewers when they read the patronizing remarks of the many keyboarders who find this device comfortable.  Some seem to pooh-pooh (usually in patronizing terms) those of us who find this one of the most wretched keyboards we have ever encountered.  It is a little hard to believe we sufferers happened to receive slightly defective devices.  The complaint I offer can be found too often in the reviews for our complaint to occur as a result of a minor or rare manufacturing defect.

On the plus side, the build quality appears to be terrific.","IMHO:  Expensive torture for thumb, hand, and arm",1384041600,

I have been using a Microsoft Comfort Curve 2000 for many years. It has served me well, and I can type really fast on it. I don't measure my WPMs but I type considerably fast you'll just have to take my word for it. I bought this keyboard thinking it would be the next iteration. Newer = better, right? I was sorely mistaken. I gave it a week and I hate this board, and I am willing to bet you will too, unless your hand is already severely deformed in a matching arc to fit this keyboard.

PROs:
It's a keyboard, and has tons of multimedia buttons. The full number pad worked well, but that's because Microsoft didn't try to do anything fancy with it. It's sleek, shiny, and black and not polka dotted or striped. And the wrist rest is some super lush exotic material that feels softer than a baby's bottom. But, that's about it for pros.

CONs:
As mentioned throughout the other reviews here, this keyboard has a really crappy space bar. I read this and thought maybe it wouldn't bother me, but it did. Not only is the space bar really hard to push down, but when you do it makes a really loud sound that is not a click, or a push, but a really unnatural sound as if you are breaking the button. I obviously did not wear the keyboard in to see if this went away but other reviews don't mention it going away.

I am a gamer. I hear you judging me, ""So why buy an ergonomic keyboard then?"" Well, I'm also a web programmer. (And btw the Comfort Curve 2000 keyboard was amazing and was NOT uncomfortable for gaming.) Anyway, the positioning of the WASD keys is perfect. However, if you are in a game where you need CTRL, SHIFT, or the space bar, you may run into issues. I had difficulty hitting those keys properly. And in a game where I had to hold ALT to run, the key did not register properly. I had to remove my hands from other keys so I could push down on ALT with all of my might in order for it to register and stay down.

I also have another issue. I'm including it, but not blaming it on the keyboard. It's apparently just a typing ""quirk"" that I have. I find that I hit a few keys ""improperly"" such as I hit the B key with my left hand. Doesn't seem that I always do this, but I apparently do it enough and with this keyboard it is impossible to do. I get that it forces you to type properly, but I don't like to conform, and I just couldn't get used to this change.

The multimedia keys were great. Except it is impossible to hit any of them reliably. You will have to turn on a light to be able to distinguish them. And, if your keyboard is on a keyboard tray like mine, that means pulling it out all the way to be able to get to those keys. (This is a big, clunky keyboard.) Not to mention, for you keyboard tray users, make sure that the arc will fit under your keyboard tray. The keyboard comes with an attachable foot to raise it up, but this raises the keyboard up so high that it won't fit under the desk. Also, I found that it raised the keyboard at such an odd angle, that it was as if you were trying to type with a wall in front of you. You know when your cat is in front of you and you're trying to keep typing while arcing your arms over the cat's back? Yeah, that's what this feels like. And you don't get the adorable cat.

Other questionable decisions: I didn't like that the F1-F12 keys all had the numbers hidden on the recessed side of the key instead of the face. And the ESC key seemed to be floating on an island where it was difficult to press. Oh and the CAPS lock and SCROLL lock lights being right at the front, well it was kind of annoying to have them shining there constantly. I like them at the top of a keyboard so I can push them under the desk ledge and not have to see them.

Overall this was a horrible decision. The 2000 keyboard series is not being made anymore, so I am going to try the 3000 and hope it is better. Until then, I type on a Logitech mini keyboard and my hands hurt like hell. OW!",Eww just ew,1383350400,

I fell off a ladder several years ago and fell hands first onto concrete.  Just a hairline fracture, but some arthritis is beginning to settle in.  I started looking into ergonomic keyboards.  They vary widely in price.  I did a lot of research and noticed that some of the more expensive boards get very mixed reviews.  Some people absolutely love them and some absolutely hate them.  It was the same with this keyboard (mixed reviews) but with a much cheaper price and Amazon's great return policy there was little risk in trying it out.  I really, really like it.  You do have to press harder (as many reviews relate) and it is a bit of adjustment, but it didn't take me long and I really don't think it's slowed my typing much.

Disassemble the keyboard.
Remove all screws on the bottom.
Remove two resting pads for your wrist.
Remove space bar, be careful.. it just requires a little prying but don't be too aggressive.
Remove two screws underneath the space bar and two screws that were underneath the wrist pads.
Remove front panel with all keys attached.

Look for the mainboard inside the assembly.
Remove three screws + 1 screw holding on mainboard assembly.
You'll notice a bunch of lines on the bottom of the mainboard and lines on the plastic as well.
It seems that these lines became unaligned on my assembly and with some adjustment it just began working again.
Make sure you check that all keys are working before putting all screws in (it would be good to have a couple of them in to keep it from falling apart)

The keyboard has a few fatal flaws for people with RSI. The first, and least serious of them, is the difficulty in pressing some keys (the chief culprit here is the Space bar). A few keys require an inordinate amount of pressure to properly depress.

The second flaw is the size of the right-hand set of keys. They take up a large amount of your desk real estate which, in turn, means that reaching over to the mouse (or trackball in my case) requires more of an effort than with a regular keyboard. This puts more stress on the wrist, which is the exact opposite of what you would want in an ergonomic keyboard.

Finally, the ""F-lock"" feature really bothers me. This ""feature"" means that the function keys (F1 through F12) are not enabled until you press the F-lock key. And you have to press it during every user session (e.g. every reboot, every wake from sleep or hibernation) in order for the function keys to be enabled. Very aggravating.

The programmability of the keyboard is a nice feature but, of course, was not one of the critical features I was looking for in an ergonomic keyboard. I would have to suggest you look elsewhere if you are in search of an ergonomic keyboard.",Not good for ergonomic purposes,1379721600,

- Nice keyboard.

CONS:
- A broken key. (I understand this could happen)
- Warranty replacement requires shipping the defective unit at *my cost* (I don't understand this)

I've been a fan of MS Natural ergonomic keyboard since late 90's. It helped a lot when I had carpal tunnel syndrome back then, and I've been buying one every 3 years or so.

This is the first black one (not gray) that I got. Some warned me about poor responsibility of the space bar. It was OK. But after a month and a half after the purchase, I found the ""b"" key was not being responsive. I had to press it all the way in for it to register, unlike other keys that require only light push. Shame on me for noticing this so late, after all the mysterious typos. (I had thought my touch typing just got more lame)

Since I missed the window to return this to Amazon, I called MS customer service, which I usually dread for any company. The call got answered in a few minutes and the talk went smooth. But in the end, they wanted it to be shipped to them at *my cost* before sending me a replacement. Maybe it's the current industry standard practice but I found that pretty bad one.

I ended up doing some physical hacking and doing my own fix.
If I'm not happy with that hack, maybe I will buy a new one, not bothering with shipping it back.
Come on, shipping it back is ~$10 shipping plus finding correct boxes and trips to/from the shipping place. Easier to shell out another $30 for a new product (which I will make sure working in the first week!).","Broken ""b"" key. Customer has to pay shipping to get warranty replacement from MS.

But since it was already on the way, I decided to just give it a try.  I wanted to replace my vintage Natural Elite PS/2, which finally failed in a way I couldn't fix it.

It arrived and, of course, I found the space bar impossible.  But I decided to persist and give it a fair trial. I remember when I had to switch back from the natural elite to the flat, my typing sucked for a few weeks

A week later... its as good as my natural elite was and I'm quite happy.  I do occasionally hit random key strokes as my pace increases, but I attribute that to it being a totally different form factor than the regular flat board I've used the last year (yeah, I procrastinated on replacing my natural elite).  I anticipate that getting better as my hands get used to the difference in keyboard.

For anyone ""on the fence"", bear in mind your hand has to get used to the changes to the keyboard.  How quickly depends on how much you type and how fast.

This is not very pretty, especially compared to the imac, but my carpal tunnel / tendentious got soooo bad, I had to do everything that I possible could to relieve some pain. This keyboard did help with my carpal tunnel pain, but it started to not work at all after a few months. I had to unplug the usb connector a couple times at first, and it seemed to work well again. But it started getting glitchy here and there after that. So, it is not terrible, but I do expect a product like this to work smoothly for at least a couple years. But-- surprisingly, it did help me with hand / wrist pain.

I actually live with extremely severe fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome (me/cfs) and it has left me with an enormously sensitive body, always in pain and unbearable exhaustion, without relief. So, I really know the difference between placebo effect and actual, real physical relief. Along with this keyboard, I really struggled with finding the best ergonomic mouse. What I ended up realizing is that TWO MOUSE devices were the best for carpal tunnel pain issues. Here is the reason:

Repetitive movement and positioning is what hurts the hands / wrists / arms so much. So-- If you constantly switch your hand / wrist positioning, you don't give the carpel tunnel channel enough time to start swelling and then pinching and then that horrible stabbing pain.. I had gotten to the point where brushing my teeth or holding a mug was unbearable. It was very scary, and honestly, depressing! It all started in early adulthood as well, which was especially depressing on many levels for me. I went to hand therapists, I had physical therapy, everything.. Still, I had so much pain. Now, after switching my desk equipment, I am 95% pain free! I seriously SERIOUSLY never thought that I would get pain relief. The key is to have an ergonomic keyboard (the slight difference in angle is enormous) and to have two differently-shaped ergonomic mouse devices connected all side-by-side.

Here is the more expensive mouse that I purchased from Amazon:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/3M-Ergonomic-Mouse-Optical-USB-PS2-Compatible-Small-Size-Black-EM500GPS/dp/B000F2BP7U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">3M Ergonomic Mouse, Optical, USB/PS2 Compatible, Small Size, Black (EM500GPS)</a>&nbsp;*Be aware of the size for your needs!

One other random thing that helps me, is something that is an all natural supplement used as a natural allergy treatment alternative. It is called D-Hist, and it uses a few all natural anti-inflammatory ingredients. The side bonus is that it helps with pain in the entire body -- and helps with allergies (at least for me. I had never heard of it before Amazon) Here is a link to D-Hist as well:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ortho-Molecular-Product-Natural-D-Hist-120-Capsules/dp/B0006ON6D8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ortho Molecular Product Natural D-Hist -- 120 Capsules</a>

Pickering,"I bought this keyboard 7 years ago when I started getting repetitive stress injuries(RSIs) in my wrists.  The combination of angled keys, wrist support, and negative tilt (decline) allowed my wrists to heal once the stresses of the old keyboard were removed.  See bottom of review for keyboard posture information.

The keyboard layout has some nuances to it, the ""enter"" and ""shift"" keys on the right hand are slightly smaller than normal, and the T/G/H/N keys are a bit larger than normal.

Once you get used to it the layout is great and promotes good typing habits.

The mute/volume/calculator buttons are really helpful.

When it broke a few years back, I ordered another.
It had a serious issue - the space bar was so hard to push that I had to whack it so hard my wife could hear me from downstairs.  In fact, all the keys were difficult to push.

I sent it back, and tried a few other models for a few years, none of which worked as well for me as the microsoft ergo.  I'm 6'2"" and have quite large hands, the generous wrist support area is key as it allows my wrists to be completely relaxed.

I ordered another out of desperation last year, fortunately microsoft must have listened to the complaints because the keys are much easier to depress, much like the original board i had from 2006.

I'm stoked to have my favorite ergo keyboard back.  When combined with good postural habits it will keep you RSI free even if you spend countless hours a day at your computer.

------------------------------
******posture info******
------------------------------

Overall posture plays a huge role in how well or poorly your wrists and hands will handle any keyboard.

Arms should be relaxed, straight down from the shoulders, with elbows bent at 90 degrees or wider.

Keyboard should be directly in front of you, with arms pointed in towards each other slightly so the wrists can be straight, not bent to the left or right.  The curved keyboard promotes this.

Wrists should extend straight out from forearms, or be tilted slightly down, resting gently on the keyboard.

Depress the keys using only enough pressure to click it completely, avoid ""pounding"" the keyboard.

If there is tension in any of the muscles of your hands, wrists, arms, or upper back, eventually you will develop an RSI.  Check each of these items (have someone snap a picture of you with your phone so you can check) and consciously adjust whatever is out of balance.",Promotes healthy wrists and hands!

Simply put, the 4000 is wonderful to type with.  I particularly like how the keyboard includes the removable elevator for the heel of your hands.  At first, it's a little awkward having a keyboard that slopes slightly downward, but I've found I actually prefer this arrangement to the original natural keyboard.  If you don't like it, it's removable so you can have it set up just like the original.

The keyboard makes no attempt to reinvent the wheel.  The arrow keys are inverted-T arrangement, the F keys are large and easy to press, and the number keypad is top-notch.  There is just enough positive feedback when pressing the keys to make effective touch typing easy.

I type 150 wpm on a slow day and I've got one of these at both my offices and at my home.  It's corded, so no batteries to replace.  It looks different and always catches everyone's attention when they see it on your desk.

I intend on stockpiling these for future use, just as I did when the original natural keyboard was discontinued.  For the money, I think this is the best keyboard on the market.

This keyboard is NOT for people who cannot touch type.  If you are looking at your keyboard to type, you need to stay with a regular one or take some keyboarding classes.  The split layout is wonderful on the wrists, but a disaster for those who have to hunt-and-peck.  I find they're the ones who are most critical of this layout whereas the folks who touch type seem to like these.

If you're new to the split layout altogether, just give it a week and you'll find your accuracy improving and your comfort level and wrist pain dimished dramatically.

I won't use anything else on any of my home computers unless I am forced to (when it breaks)

My only gripe with this keyboard is the CLEANING. Good lord. Let me preface this by saying I am very careful taking apart electronics, I dismantle computers and other electronics as well as build them. This thing just HATES to be touched. I have owned 2 of these, and the only time they stop working is when I pull them apart to clean it.

My first one I pulled apart and cleaned, but about half the keys stopped working for no reason. Albeit I may have touched the tracers leading to the keys and other things, but I wasn't rough with it nor pulled things apart.

My second one, I had got so filthy I couldn't stand it, (a few days ago) so I took it apart. I never touched a single piece of the electronic hardware. (Note: When you unscrew the bottom, the key top part separates from the bottom part with all the hardware, so you can just clean the top part without messing with the bottom part) I spent a good 2-3 hours taking the keys off one by one, putting them in warm soapy water, then cleaning them, letting them dry, and re-assembling them. I blew some canned air on the bottom part (underneath the electronics where the dust settles) and then put it back together. Mission accomplished!

My only complaint with the layout and feel of the keyboard is that the right space bar can be very stiff, which is moderately annoying. The problem I have is that the keyboard doesn't work on either my desktop or on my laptop.

I ordered one from Amazon, plugged it directly into my desktop, and booted. It worked fine with the Windows boot manager, but once Windows 7 64 came up, it was completely dead. A little research online showed me that others have had problems getting their PC to recognize the keyboard, so I tried plugging it into my laptop to see if it was a compatibility issue. Didn't work with my new Lenovo T430 running Windows 7 64, either. Looked online, and all the Microsoft support site was effectively useless. It focused on making sure that I had the keyboard plugged in correctly, and had me re-download and re-install the Windows multimedia keyboard drivers/app. I did all that, but the installs always failed to recognize the keyboard. In Device Manager, the keyboard shows as attached, but says the drivers cannot be found. It looked like I got a bad keyboard.

Amazon was great about returning the keyboard for a new one.

The new keyboard came, but once again it didn't work with my desktop. It did work with my laptop, though...until I rebooted it. Then it just stopped working with the laptop, also. Went through the re-installation drill again on both machines. Same symptoms, same results. No joy.

I've given up on this device. Apparently it works for most PCs, or there'd be a lot more reviews like this one, but it is not universally compatible, and to my knowledge there's no way to tell if it will work for your PC or not. Check online to see if anyone has found a way to verify that this keyboard will work on your system before you buy it.","0 for 2, twice",1373155200,

I was very disappointed when they discontinued that model and replaced it with one that was much more cheaply made and only had rear risers. When I found the they had released the Natural Keyboard 4000 I was very excited. Well, about as excited as you can get about keyboards. How much do I love this keyboard? I just relocated from the US to Singapore, and I made sure to pack one to take with me to use at the office.

I have two of them - one for home and one for the office. They're very comfortable to type on, and I believe I'm a much faster typer when I use them. They're also very well built. I've been banging away on the one at the office for about five years so far and aside from the tops of the keys wearing smooth and the key labels wearing away they function perfectly. The rear risers make my wrists happy, as does the wrist rest pad.

I think my only concern will be the longevity of the wrist rest padding. The original Microsoft Natural keyboard had a hard plastic wrist rest that was just as durable as you'd expect hard plastic to be, while the 4000 has a padded rest. It's more comfortable, but at the cost of durability.

While good, the wireless version could never keep up with my typing. And yes, I had fresh batteries.

However, I loved the keyboard layout, and the front riser. Basically, there's a little lift you can use to prop up the front of the keyboard. It's takes some getting used to since most people prop up the rear of the keyboard.

Turns out, for your wrists, it's better to have the front lifted up, rather than the rear.

Anyways, I recently bought a new computer, so I got the USB version of this keyboard to go along with it. Awesome.

The special buttons are easy to program. Another review mentioned that you couldn't program the 'Web Browser"" button to launch something other that IE. Not for me. You can very easily change it to launch Chrome or anything else. The ""control panel"" for it is very easy and intuitive.

Anyways, by this one. The USB version. IT's half the price of the wireless version, and you'll never lose keystrokes.

As other reviewers have noted, the space bar is terrible, to the point of being unusable. There is simply no excuse for this. The spacebar has to be hit almost dead center or it binds up. This means you almost always have to take your fingers off the home keys in order to strike it properly.

That alone is enough to warrant the one star review, but it gets worse.

I tried uninstalling the software, and even went back to my standard Dell keyboard, but there was no way to get that option back.  I finally gave in and bought a Microsoft mouse, but this limitation should be advertised before you buy and install this product.

And the funny thing is, I never even use all the special funtions the keyboard software supports.  I like the keyboard primarily for the shape, the placement of the keys and the wrist rest.

I settled on this model, thinking it would fit the bill for my home office.  When I got the unit, I was immediately surprised and dismayed, because I could not tell from the picture that the keyboard is wavy on the vertical axis.  I know it is described as an ergonomic keyboard, so that is partially my fault, but it has wrist support, and the keys appear to be arced on the horizontal axis, so I thought that was where the ergonomics started and stopped.  Not so.  The keyboard has a VERY prominent hump where the home row keys are split, and the space bar falls on this split.  I'm sure there are many people who can take to this type of layout right away and wonder what their hands have been missing their whole lives, but not I.  In addition to the hump making it feel very awkward like I had never typed before, but also the spaebar is centered squarely on the hump, with only one point of actuation on the hump, so if you don't take extra care to press down deliberately hard, close to the center, the spacebar won't register a keystroke.  If I had to write this review with that keyboard, it would have taken me 20 minutes because I would have to backspace and then peck at the spacebar with my index finger, novice typist style, to make sure it registers a keystroke.  The combination of the hump and the difficult to press spacebar made me decide within about 3 minutes that I couldn't keep the keyboard.  For those of you that like this thing, more power to you, but as a touch typist, even without the hump, the spacebar is disruptive enough to take me back to about 20 wpm with constant corrections, if even that.",Difficult to type with,1368144000,

After finally breaking, I was forced to buy the new one since the old ones are being sold for 100 dollars on some sites...
First off, the angle of the keys are odd, I have let my friends and family use my new keyboard and they would immediately start mistyping, and personally, my words per seconds plummeted at first. I eventually got used to it, but even with the odd key lay out, and the over sized N key, the buttons are very strange. They are a combination of two soft/loose and to firm at the same time. First time I pressed the space key my thumb merely bounced off the key, and when I would hit it successfully, it would sometimes make a strange grinding sound. VERY unimpressed with the quality, the keys will break and fall out of this keyboard eventually I have no doubt. Comparing it to the old microsoft natural, the keys move and can be rotated within the keyboard where the older version, they only move straight up and down. This keyboard was not meant to last. If the price of the original was anywhere NEAR the ergonomic 4000, you should buy the older version.

I have kept them going through the use of usb to ps2 adapters, but one by one these boards are dying... I was saddened to see that Microsoft had stopped production of the USB version of these boards.

The closest thing I could find to those is this board, complete with the raised front wierdness, and some actually pretty nice adjustability.

I purchased a pair of these for now. Will likely buy more as the need arises. Below is the overview of what I found to be the good and the bad about them.  The first board replaced my Natural Keyboard Elite that had the 10 key portion fail on it at home. The other replaced the Adesso TruForm that was given to me by my company as an ergo board when my first Natural Elite outright died. It just wouldn't come up at all...

The good.
- Key layout similar to the Natural Elite. Hand and wrist position more or less unchanged.
- Not white. I liked my Natural, and wanted a black one when everything changed from white to black. This board is actually fairly attractive.
- Angle adjustment options. The riser on the front is removeable, there are feet under the back, so you can raise the entire thing, raise just the front, just the back, or set it level. Depending on how my hands / arms feel on a given day, I keep mine either level, or rear raised.
- Overall good tactile feel to the keys. A little softer than the Natural, a LOT softer than the Addesso.
- None of the keys stick. The left shift key on the Addesso sticks, ALL the time, that can be a problem when coding, or typing up long documents.
- Gel cushioned wrist rests.
- The standard keys / buttons at least, work with a KVM switch no problem.

The bad.
- First and foremost, it's not a black version of the Natural Keyboard Elite. For better or worse that board is gone. I loved my Elites, and would happily have gotten new ones.
- The space bar on the right side takes more pressure than any other key to actuate on one of the boards. It is loosening up as I use it, but it does slow my typing down a bit.

The weird.
- Front riser block thing a ma jig. I am not sure how that could be comfortable to use. I took them off of both boards and set them aside. Seems like a HUGE waste of plastic to me.
- No included driver software, but the extended functions like the Zoom slider don't work on Windows XP without an added driver. Haven't tried it on Windows 7 or Linux yet. Some of the buttons work, some don't. The little flyer in the box does a LOUSY job of explaining it.

Summary.
- Contstruction quality slightly below the older boards, but still far above the competing current boards.
- Good feel when typing.
- Sticky / too much pressure space bar out of the box is annoying. But seems to wear in fairly quickly.

I have a need for 2 other keyboards, 1 for another desktop and 1 for a laptop docking station at home. I will be buying these boards again for those applications. If it weren't for the sticky spacebar, and missing driver CD I would have given this board 5 stars.

I used it to replace a Microsoft Natural Elite keyboard. The wrist/palm rests feel very nice, and I like the fact that the keys are quiet - I'm trying to train myself to take notes while on the phone using the computer instead of using a pad of paper, and I find that loud typing while I'm talking on the phone can interfere with my hearing the other person, and with their perception of my attention. The software does seem relatively Spartan but to be honest I'm not a big user of customization features, so it doesn't impact my use of the device. In the past, I haven't even bothered to install keyboard driver software. The zoom feature works nicely in Firefox, I don't use IE much.

So, for my use - standard typing for many hours/day, minimal use of special features - it's a great keyboard. I'm glad it's got the older-style cursor key/insert-delete-scroll key setup, rather than the setup used on the Natural Elite, that I never did really

Chances are pretty good I'll buy another one to use at home this weekend - I am really happy with this, enough so that I'm ready to give up the old ergo keyboard I've got at home that doesn't have the negative tilt but does have the arrow-key configuration that I prefer.

While today's keyboards aren't as horrible as some of my youth--here's looking at you, Commodore 64!--they nonetheless can cause various maladies to development if used constantly.  In my line of work as a network administrator and full-time family tech support geek I'm typing quite a lot, and I remember seeing Microsoft's announcement about their new ""Natural"" Keyboard, back around 1994 or 1995.  I laughed at it--it looked silly, what with the split down the middle and the angling of the keys on each side.  It was as if Dali had spoken to someone at Microsoft and won the bet in a bar...

Right.  Well, around 1998 I started getting both numbness and painful cramping in my wrists and hands.  Guess what?  I ended up trying that original, bizarre Natural keyboard and it was TOUGH.  Took a great deal of training, trying to re-acclimate my hands to where the keys had been moved, and my typing speed hit a brick wall during the process.  Thankfully, however, after untold Mavis Beacon sessions and lessening pain and numbness, I persevered.

I now use this current model, the MS Natural Keyboard 4000, on all my desktop computers and laptops with docking stations.  I can attest firsthand the difference it has made in the quality of my life, given my line of work: I don't have to take pain medications constantly, I'm not relegated to using voice dictation software and suffering the speed and accuracy penalties often associated with it, and I don't dread long-term input sessions.

PRO's:
--Relatively inexpensive
--Not gaudy in appearance; black, grey, and silver colors don't stand out in a professional environment
--Keys are fairly quiet (although this could be a ""con""--see below)
--Wired - no batteries to replace or recharge!
--Numlock, Shiftlock and Capslock lights are centrally located and easily seen
--Integrated wrist rest is sloped just about right and uses a sort of anti-sweating material.  It works well for me.
--Most important feature: the angling ""in"" of the two halves of the keyboard allow the wrists to be more or less ""at ease"" when typing, resulting in lower stress on the joints and muscles when compared to traditional flat-across keyboards.

CON's:
--Keys are fairly quiet; if you want a keyboard with deafening clackety-clack audible and tactile feedback, this rubber-dome keyboard isn't for you.  Get an old IBM buckling springs one instead.
--Due to the rubber-dome nature of the construction, this keyboard won't last forever (unlike some of those old IBM keyboards mentioned above--wow).  However, that said, I type a great deal and still manage a good 3-4 years on these before I start having one or two keys fail to work 100% of the time.
--The retraining period isn't easy and may well take a bit longer than you'd expect; stick with it, though, and it's quite likely you just might end up typing _faster_ than on standard old keyboards--and hurting less, to boot!

BOTTOM LINE:
  It's a bit of a specialty market product, perhaps...  but if you're a person suffering from carpal tunnel/RTI or other issues around your wrists when you type, you owe it to yourself to at least try this style of keyboard.  It's made a significant difference for me and I'm very grateful for this product.","Comfortable, Pain-Free Typing (if You're Willing to Try it)",1362960000,

To be a little bit more explicit, here is the problem. On a conventional keyboard, the space bar is large.

On this microsoft keyboard, I literally cannot depress the keyboard if I try to depress the keyboard at the upper-right(or left)-most point of the space bar. The difficulty of pressing the space bar is decreasing as you get towards the center of the bar, but who in their right mind presses the space bar there?

Specifically I'm referring to the latest ""retina"" displays. So much research and engineering has gone into displays that their resolution is on par with the human eye. Granted there's more work to be done with color, contrast, and intensity but it's still arguably impressive, not to mention beautiful to look at.

So what about input? Touch displays got its kick start with the first iPhone and even Microsoft has seen the light with Windows 8. But touch displays suck for anything other than basic input. What about keyboards? If you type a lot (like me) this makes a big difference, even more if you actually type and don't ""peck."" I've always been at a loss by how complacent people are when it comes to keyboards. A cheap flat keyboard (usually the one that came with the computer) is the de-facto standard helped along with companies who give you a puzzled look when you ask for something better.

The Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 is better. It's also rather cheap, provides a good typing angle, both between your arms (allowing you to stick your elbows out) and between it and the desk surface (so you can avoid bending your hands backwards). I don't use the extra keys so I won't comment on their utility. The tactile feedback is soft, which I think allows for smoother typing rather than the mechanical typewriter style of making sure you press hard enough to make each letter legible on the paper. It also feels rather solid and comfortable, especially the padding at the bottom.

The Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 will assuage concerns of carpal tunnel syndrome while providing some of the best typing you will ever experience on any keyboard ever made.

I've been using a 4000 since its initial release in 2003. It is the first keyboard I've ever owned that I have to replace because I WEAR IT OUT like running shoes.

* First Timers *

If you've never used a 4000 before, you'll find that there is a slight learning curve, even with experience with previous models of Microsoft Natural Keyboards. The incline which places your wrists in proper typing position (a position that few of us learned, much less execute properly). This typing position may feel odd at first, but prevents any onset of carpal tunnel syndrome - an unfortunate condition I refer to as the Career Ender for anyone in a profession where writing is a primary activity.

* Functionality *

In addition to being a splendid ergonomic keyboard, this is the first of Microsoft's lineup where I use the quick-access keys. A Play/Pause button interfaces with iTunes and other MP3 software without programming, the mute and volume buttons are outstanding, and I cannot tell you how useful a Calculator button is (which came as a surprise even to me that I would use it as often as I do).

* Overall *

I've bought a 4000 for every computer I've ever used (including when I worked at corporate locations where a 4000 wasn't provided). It's an invaluable piece of my daily computing, and I recommend it to anyone who is seeking an excellent ergonomic keyboard solution.

* About Me *

I type 125 words-per-minute without errors and write for a living. In other words, this review is written by a person who only puts their keyboards on light use - I am a heavy user and will break any keyboard I have over time (it's just the repetitive impact nature of the job). That being said, the 4000 holds up to heavy, unending use.

Fuchs,"I got this keyboard for my office but still use the older Natural Keyboard Elite at home. The older keyboard is much more comfortable and responsive and I really wish Microsoft would bring it back.

This keyboard, while more attractive than the older model, is much harder to use. The keys are a lot stiffer and control key commands are slow. On the Elite, you can pretty much press the control key and the alphabetic key at the same time. On this keyboard, you have to hold down the control key a brief moment before you press the other key. If you don't, unexpected errors occur - for instance if, when copying text, you hit the ""C"" key too quickly, it deletes the text and won't paste it when you hit ctrl-V.

The function keys can be used for internet scrolling, but since I primarily use my mouse for that, I just find that all the extra keys and functions clutter up the keypad. Plus, the letters are harder to see on a black background, although on the plus side, it doesn't get as dirty as the cream-colored Elite. And while, in theory the strip at the bottom of the keyboard ought to be more comfortable because of the padding, it isn't.

I could live with all the other issues if it weren't for the stiffness of the keys and the sluggishness of the response when using ctrl commands.  I'll take the comfort of an ergonomic keyboard over a standard keyboard any day, but it's almost worth paying the exorbitant fees to find an older model just because of how much easier the actual typing is.

I own three of these keyboards: one for my laptop at work, one for my desktop at home and a 2nd keyboard at home for the work laptop. The keyboard is comfortable and I especially appreciate the wrist rest. The option to elevate the front of the keyboard is an added plus, although I have to admit not using it considering my height and the heights of my chair and desk. For taller/shorter users it may provide the optimal angle.

The other bonus for this keyboard: the extra buttons along the top edge. The mute button is extremely useful at work. I've also programmed the ""My Favorites"" buttons for those programs I use all the time.

Installation via the USB plug is easy and it takes just a second or two for the system to recognize the keyboard (I'm running Windows 7).

One hint suggestion: Download the Microsoft IntelliType software - it makes setting up the keyboard and all those extra buttons a breeze. (Type Microsoft IntelliType into Google and select the
'Software Downloads | Microsoft Hardware' link. Select the 'Keyboards' tab then look for the Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 link; or try cutting & pasting this: [...]).

Another useful tip: clean the wrist rest every other day - I use Clorox wipes. I've found this keeps the wrist rest clean and free of oils & dust (dead skin cells).

One other note regarding the issues that serveral users have experienced: The space bar is a bit stiff, but it loosened up after 2-3 weeks. I have noticed some fading of the letters, but this has only been after several years of daily use (I've had my work keyboard for almost three years). I have one keyboard crap out on me after a year (my home keyboard); one phone call to Microsoft had a replacement shipped out and I received it within a week.

Overall a great keyboard - if I had to pick one 'Con' I would say the keyboard itself has a rather large footprint (set aside at least an 11""x20"" area on your desk). Considering the usefulness of the wrist rest and the extra buttons, this is a very minor issue.

5 Star Requirements
- Price point must be reasonable (I'd expect a $500 keyboard to be great)
- Must hold up to daily use with no (or very few) issues
- Must be easy to use (e.g., I don't have to sing while standing on one leg to get it to work)

Absolutely the most comfortable keyboard I've ever used. If you spend a lot of time typing, this may be just what you need. However... there is one major flaw: the space bar. It often sticks or is slow to come back up & it makes a clacking sound each time you press it. I considering sending it back, but after doing an online search discovered this keyboard problem has existed for years. There are numerous pages with ""fixes"" for the problem.
While I will not recommend my solution (because it seems absurd to be fixing a new keyboard), here is what I did to fix my space bar:
  I love to kayak fish, so of course I always have some 303 Protectant on hand. I discovered years ago that cleaning my PC trackballs with 303 made 'em very slick, so I figured whatever was sticking on the keyboard could be ""303ed"".
The space bar came right off using a small bent screwdriver. I was careful not to bend the small steel tension bar underneath & pried the space bar up side to side so it didn't come off at an angle. I found that the ""clacking"" is caused by the bottom of the space bar hitting against a plastic surface, so this was an easy fix with a piece of sticky-back Velcro. I used a cotton swab to apply 303 to the plastic posts & inserts (1 center, 2 smaller each side of space bar) & also put some at the little tension bar pivot points for good measure. It's been several weeks now & the space bar hasn't stuck once & I sure don't miss that clacking either.

All the keys are lively - if you want the 'typing on a sponge' feeling, keep looking.
The customization keys are handy as are the added keys above the number pad.
The Zoom and scroll functions are handy - very handy in my case.
No wider than most, the front-to-back depth is almost 10"" - so you need some room but the wrist rest is welcome.
Overall the board has a quality feel - durable, with the possible exception of the pop-up feet to adjust the height of the back of the board - had a problem with these on the 2000 (they snapped off) but it is not a mission-failure flaw as it's fixable.
Comes with no instruction, but self installs - at least under Win 7 64-bit (my machine).
Overall, the best keyboard I've had.  The 'bump' in the middle also helps relieve strain.
Since I keyboard 6 - 10 hours a day, comfort, fit, and function are all important.
This scores tops on all three. I do love this keyboard!  (And I'm no fan of Microsoft)",Easier on wrists -- and improves spelling  I love it!,1356048000,

At first it was a little hard training my hands and fingers on this split keyboard. Once I learned where all the keys were I was able to touch type, which is a huge time saver for me since I had always been a hunt and peck. Now I can type without looking and I can type for longer periods of time without having my shoulders, arms, or hands hurting. I also have been able to increase the words per minute.

I wouldn't want to use any other type of keyboard.

Pro: The cost was a huge plus for me. I purchased it while it was on sale so I purchased 2 of them for less than $30 each.
The keyboard is very well built. It has taken several emotional outbursts, where I have hit the keyboard with my fists without breaking anything. The favorite Keys are great. I program them for all my tools that i use on a daily bases. In addition the shortcut pre-programmed keys for Internet Explorer, Email, Calculator, as well as the multimedia controls which I use to control my iTunes while I work.

Con: The layout of the function keys always seems to cause problems for me. When I reach for the F5 key I seem to always miss and hit the Favorites 1, 2 or the Favorites star key. Since I don't use the F5 much it isn't a big deal but can cause some frustration because it breaks the flow of work. The only other Con is the retail cost. I have found that it is an item that is on sale a few times a year.

I like the fact that this is a wired/USB keyboard. Not because i'm afraid of someone stealing my keystrokes... but because batteries on my previous wireless keyboards always seem to die in the most inopportune time with me not having a replacement.

The keyboard has a nice shape to it... if you're looking for an ergonomic keyboard! If you don't like the split keys - obviously don't buy this. I've noticed some people complaining a little bit about sticking keys. I did not experience that issue on the two that I bought. (luck?)

The key strokes are very soft/silent. My hands rest naturally on the keyboard. I like the little function buttons above like calculator. There's a zoom toggle between the two keyboard halves. Could be useful in some web situations. I like the indicator lights in the middle of the keyboard's hand rest as well.

I bought this keyboard on two occasions for two VERY different prices. Here on Amazon a few months back for $34 and on newegg (on sale) a few days ago for $19.99.

I've always wanted to try the ergonomic style keyboards, and the price was right with this model hence my first try at this keyboard style. I won't lie, it takes some time getting acclimated to the key layout and the fact that Microsoft also split the number and F-keys doesn't make it easier. Luckily the cursor keys and number pad stay familiar. It took me about 2-3 days to get used to the split layout, and it does help you type ""correctly"" as I have grown sloppy over the years with using the wrong finger for the keys. It is a bad habit I developed from years of first-person shooter gaming where I'd use a mouse and keyboard together.

The shortcut keys are a big help, and once Windows 7 detected my new keyboard, it automatically installed Microsoft Intellipoint Type which produces an on-screen display for the volume adjustments. This OSD pops up whenever you use the volume adjustment shortcut keys on the keyboard. The Web/Home and Search keys work properly, but the Mail shortcut key directed me to Outlook by default even though my default mail program was Mozilla Thunderbird. I had to manually reset the shortcut key to Thunderbird via the Intellipoint software.

The integrated zoom feature is awesome but only works if you have the Intellipoint software installed. I use the keyboard at work where the drivers are not permitted, but when I evaluated the zoom feature at home it worked like a charm. The back and forward keys work fine without the driver, as does the calculator shortcut key. The coolest feature of this keyboard is the soft integrated palmrest. It feels like a thin foam padded wrest but it has a nice synthetic cover. It is extremely comfortable to use.

Overall: 5/5 stars, some time is required to acclimate to the split layout, and I still find myself mistyping words after over a week of use. My typing speeds have slowed down somewhat, but I am confident it will pick up with additional practice. Awesome integrated palmrest, useful and handy shortcut keys.","Comfortable to use, but the split layout takes time for familiarization",1355702400,

Flores,"I got this keyboard like what many others had in mind: To relieve or prevent carpal tunnel syndrome that comes with straight keyboards. At first, this keyboard was fantastic and it immediately relieved my wrist pain. However, two years later, I have actually gone back to my old Apple Wireless Keyboard because the ergonomic one feels decidedly 'spongy.' In other words, typing doesn't feel crisp, but rather mushy and requires a lot of force to type. It becomes quite fatiguing when writing long essays, or if you have to type for a living, like a software engineer or aspiring writer. You may like it at first, to relieve your pain, but may find yourself going back to 'crisper' keyboards to combat typing fatigue.

Sidenote: I've also disassembled and air-pressure canned my keyboard clean, and it still feels mushy. I'm not sure if it was mushy when I first got it, but it is definitely mushy two years after getting it. My wife noticed the difference immediately; it may have taken me a little longer to get around to it.","Just Okay - Relives Carpal Tunnel Pain, But Mushy Keys Are A Drawback",1355616000,

Big hands?  Wrist injury or arthritis?  This keyboard is perfect.

When I discovered a few years ago how much easier it is to type on an ergonomic keyboard, I set out to find the best one for me.  This one was it.  I tried Logitch, Fellowes, and a few others I can't remember.  Some split, some wave.  When I sat down and started typing with this keybaord for the first time, I knew I had found the Mercedes of keyboards.

There are a few ""problems"" which keep it from getting 5 stars from me.

1. The space bars do tend to need an extra kick from time to time to get them to depress.
2. No backlight.
3. No macro buttons for gaming.

The spacebar issue can be overcome through use.  Once you've used the keyboard enough it will loosen up, and you will also program yourself to subconsciously give it a little more encouragement when you hit it.

The lack of a backlight is becoming a killer for me.  As my eyes get older I find it more difficult to see the letters on the keyboard.  I am not a touch typist, though I can type around 80 error-free wpm while keeping the keys in my peripheral vision.  Backlighting would help me to keep track of the keys.

Macro buttons...I play games on my computer as well, and macro buttons (like on the Microsoft Sidewinder series) would be welcomed.

If you are looking for an exellent general use keyboard, and have any of the issues I noted above, you should get this keyboard.  It takes a week or so to really get the hang of the split keyboard, but once you get it, you will find it near impossible to type on a regular keyboard.

I have two of these...one for home and one for work.

To be completely honest, I just bought the MS Sidewinder X4 to replace the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 at home.  I do less typing there now than when I was in grad school, and much less than at work (where my job is writing things all day).  The Sidewinder X4 solves all three issues I have with this keyboard...it does however introduce new issues...like wrist allignment and such, but for gaming I just reposition the keyboard as needed.

At work?  No question...it's Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000, and only Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 that will work for me.

Key spacing and positions are a little different from standard keyboards which takes a little getting used to, but you'll have it down in just an hour or so.  The split and angled keyboard can be custom positioned for proper wrist positioning, which will make for much safer usage.  The keys have a good, positive feel; action is quick and controlled.  Other user comments about the space-bar stiffness may be somewhat exaggerated: a positive click is required, but it's not difficult to use.  This keyboard is recommended for users with mild-to-moderate carpal tunnel symptoms and for everyone who wants to avoid future problems.  It is not, however, adequate for users with major deficits who should look for more radical solutions.","A full-featured, ergonomic keyboard.",1338076800,

I am one of those people that do not enjoy typing on a laptop keyboard since it's too small.  I want that nice key stoke feedback from a full size keyboard and always liked the Microsoft Keyboard product offerrings.  When I came upon this one I was thinking how in the world am I going to type in this weird ergonomic position.  A couple of days later, I realized how could I have not been typing this way for so long.  Initially it does need some getting used too, but someone must have done the reasearch, since once you get started you will not want to go back to a normal position keyboard.  I also hope I am preventing further long term issues for my fingers, hands and wrists by typing in this ergo position, but for now I continue to like the feeback of the key strokes and at least mentally I believe I am typing even quicker and with more accuracy (I thank my lucky stars that I took Senior Year High School Typing Class!).

The existence of a wrist pad is always good, but there is a plastic platform that can be installed underneath the keyboad to raise it off the surface which then angles your typing downwards in a supposed better ergo position.  I did notice there is no SLEEP button like from my previous keyboard, but you soon forget about this and just either use your mouse or close your laptop cover.

In addition I have to say that I like the additional email function keys to further reduce your time using the mouse.  Especially that ""SEND"" button.  Lastly I always preferred a corded Keyboard since I keep the keyboard on a table surface at all times and dont' have to worry about charging the keyboard or replacing the batteries.",I am a believer now,1337904000,

As with the Elite, the Natural 4000 has a good split layout on which my fingers fit naturally and comfortably, reducing the strain for long-term typing that I can otherwise feel in the back of my hands. Some of the additional functions not present on the Elite, such as volume control, are appreciated.

I do, though, miss the clickier feel of the Elite; the Natural 4000 has a softer, quieter key feel that is probably better in crowded offices but gives a bit less tactile feedback. I also do not like the software that comes with the Natural 4000; there's no easy way to reconfigure certain keys (e.g. turning the less-than-useful zoom switch into a scroll switch), and the brightness ""feature"" accessed by typing control-left arrow and control-right arrow can interfere with using those key combinations for text navigation.

The 4000 went back to the store the the next day and I replaced it with a Natural Keyboard Elite.

The problem, that would be the space bar.  I really liked everything else about the product, but could not get around the space bar. It does NOT engage when pressed, usually on either of the outer areas at the corners.  I am a touch typist and this space bar significantly dropped by speed and increase my error rate.  I tried to train myself to press more to the center of the space bar which worked just fine, but time and time again I would find myself pressing one or the other of the ""little wings"" with the result of no action and no space produced.

I have used the natural keyboard for 18 years and would choose nothing else.  But this keyboard is just very poorly designed for a touch typist.  A newcomer or hunt and pecker would probably not have this trouble with the space bar.

I would have given it only one star but liked the other functionality of the keys and especially the raised lip on the bottom of the wrist side of the keyboard.  I have been using a negative angle on my keyboards for many years and just find that is the less stressful way to type.  (negative angle is when the edge of the keyboard where the space bar is,is higher than the further edge of the keyboard, where the function keys are).  This position allows the fingers, wrists and forearms all to be in a natural straight line, there by decreasing at least one of the causes of carpal tunnel syndrome.","Wonderful, comfortable, BUT....",1336953600,

That and people complained about the cramped numberpad which I use a lot.  I even tried looking for a split that at least had some kind od padding like the 4000 but all I found was either gel or plastic.  I ended up coming right back to this one.  It may not be stylish as a logitech, or as solid as a 80's mechanical keyboard but this thing still beats them all at comfort and reliablity.

Actual Review:

The keys are pretty silent but I type kind of fast and hard so there is some muted clacking but it's pretty light.  The keys themselves have a matted feel to them and spring back up when you press down.  You don't need a lot of force to press but you know you pressed a key.  Rarely can you accidently press a key and not know you did (never happened to me but I guess these things can happen).

There are reviews about the how you have to press near the center of the spacebar to register a ""space"" but I've never had that.  The spacebar is oversized and my thumbs rest directly on it without any effort on my part.  Some split keys boards have the two spacebars or the oddly shaped one but this board has an oversized one that spands the entire split.

I've never set up the ""My Favorites"" keys so I can't comment on those but I saw somewhere online that you could substitute macros rather than *.exe or homepages.  (If I find it again I'll edit this post.)

The Zoom button I use rarely but only when I need to up the font size in Notepad++.

I use the hell out of the volume and calculator buttons.  The play button works in iTunes but is really meant for Windows Media Player.  The volume controls are meant for the system sound not as a media player control.

My programming enviroments do not recognize the ""=""/""(""/"")"" keys found above the numberpad but this is due mainly to such old software (VS6) but Word (even 2010) sees them.

Cons:

The only real complaint I have is that there is no real wireless version.  The 7000 I think is wireless but you need to use the mouse and I have no need for it (I use a Logitech VX at home and a MX at work).

And just a note, depending on what OS and hardware you are on the volume controls can take up to a 3-4 seconds to adjust the volume.  I'm pretty sure on a fast system that you won't even notice a lag if there is one.

Remarks:

After 5 years of solid use the key that were oringally matte are now shiny and a few letters have rubbed off but the keyboard still works just as it did the day I first set it up.  It's been to 3 different companies and survived 2 moves.  The pleather/leather is still the same color as it was, no rips, no fading, no tearing apart, no little pieces flaking off, etc.  A rubber foot did come off but that happened like a few months ago which agains speaks volumes about the overall construction.  And the little led lights on the bottom still work!

One department in our hospital loves these keyboards for some strange reason. I have always been perturbed by how the keyboard is split incorrectly. That is, against the normal teaching method of using the right hand to access the number 6. I also can't stand to spread my hands sideways like I'm massaging a beach ball.

Aside from that they have been a huge pain in the neck. The failure rate for these keyboards is very high compared to our standard HP and Lenovo keyboards. They just are not durable. We've had many fail because the cord gets an open or short circuit. We've had even more get the dreaded stuck key issue. Even though the key doesn't appear to be physically stuck, but the key will repeat itself ad infinitum. It has been the space bar mostly, but other keys also suffer the same problem. Unfortunately these have been a thorn in the side because of their reliability problems. If reliability is important to you there are better choices like a true mechanical keyboard (pricey), or even just a name brand business keyboard.

EDIT: I just had another one fail. That is 4 in one week. Fortunately Microsoft replaces them free of charge (90 day warranty from date of initial call); you just have to wait on hold for 35 minutes so they can troubleshoot. Next time I will wait a while to call so I can group them all together and only call once.

EDIT 6/2012: Two more just failed. This time Microsoft wants the old ones sent back. Last time I was told that I just needed to keep the old ones for warranty purposes. ??
EDIT 6/2012: One more failed. Microsoft must have changed manufacturers recently, since these keyboards have normally held up much better than this.

It has an 'odd' shape as you can see from the pictures included in the product description.  It took some time to adjust to this from the old style ergo boards.  It has a rubber 'mat' at the bottom that for me does nothing beyond provide a grippy surface, I purchsed a wrist wrap&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Handstands-Wrist-Rest-59220/dp/B0006TIEV2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Handstands Wrist Rest 59220</a>, as my prior board was not comfortable and I intended on using it with that or this if it it needed it.  It turned out for me that it was needed, in addition to the rubber mat on this board doing little for my comfort the back and forward keys located under the space bar are too easy for me to hit when typing on this.  With the wrist rest I now have clearance over them though can no longer see the LED's for Num/Scroll/Caps LOCK.

I think it was noted in another review the keys are not painted on but stickers, my fear was they'd be cheap stickers and come off, well I was wrong about that.  They are however still cheap in that they wear off from use, perhaps not cutting my fingernails super short?, I've got 2 keys that lost almost half their white lettering after 4 months and a third just starting. My previous keyboards went years before letters started to fade/wear off but not this one.

I'll add I'm not a fan of the limited choices in ergo boards, the small enter key, the cross style of arrows or reduced backspace key.  This was the best fit for the layout I wanted that I could find and wasn't priced ridiculously, I don't think I even found an outrageously priced one that was my 'perfect' layout.

Finally I'll state the obvious it is black and hard to see if you have low or poor lighting, with my monitors I'm often somewhat 'blinded' to see keys instantly.  Just something to remember when choosing this, white letters are nice but in a field of black they don't stand out that much against a couple of 23"" screens, even worse if the letters start to fade.

I can type a million words a minute (or so it seems) on this thing, compared to hunt-and-peek index finger typing on a straight keyboard. Once you've gone natural, my friends, you can't go straight again.

I switched to using an ergo keyboard 10 years ago (due to wrist pain from using standard keyboards) and I won't go back.  It took about 3 days to get used to it. Not only is it painless for me to type on an ergo keyboard, I actually type faster.

So what is preventing me from giving this product five stars?  It lacks USB ports.  My previous ergo Microsoft keyboard had two USB ports, which made it easy to plug in the mouse!!  Without those ports, I have two wires heading to the computer tower instead of one.

Melancon,"I've had this keyboard for about a year now, and it just hit me--I haven't had the slightest twinge of wrist pain since I got it.  In fact, I'd forgotten all about the issue.

If you've been on a flat keyboard all day, roll your wrists out about 45 degrees and see what a relief that is.

If you are on the Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard right now, twist your wrists up into the position a flat keyboard requires and you'll probably think to yourself, ""My god, how did I ever make it through a whole day like that?""  (I just tried it, and that was exactly what I thought.)

Flat keyboards are bad for you.  If you are having wrist problems from typing, you should probably get one of these.

I just wish they'd start making keyboards dishwasher safe.

I have been using this keyboard for over 8 years now and I continue to be happy with the results.  I am a programmer and type all day long.  My wrists started hurting years ago and surgery became a consideration.  By switching to this keyboard and using a mouse pad with a wrist support I have been able to avoid surgery and do my work without pain.  The result is an improvement in my life due to changing to this ergonomic keyboard.

The tilt and angles, including the split takes a bit of time to adapt to, but once done it's very easy to use and does feel natural.  There's a raised front edge piece but due to the height I like to keep my desk at I take that off and use the keyboard in a more level posture.  On Win7 and the newer you don't need any special software, in fact it no longer comes with any, support is built into the OS now.  While there a programmable keys for misc features, I don't use any of that and actually would prefer that they were removed and that the keyboard was smaller.

I get a few years out of each keyboard and do my best to keep them clean and dry, water doesn't do nice things for anything plugged into power ;-)  After enough time the keys get a polished look and then the printed text on the keys starts to wear off, but I'm a touch typer anyways so that hasn't been an issue, enough of the letters are there to still assure my hands are in the right place.  What rubs off and where on each key depends on your personal hand placements.

I pair my keyboard up with the Belkin Waverest Gel Mouse Pad and am happy with the results and looks on my desk.

For whatever reason, I moved away from the ergonomics and have had standard keyboards for a while now. My Dell keyboard recently gave up the ghost so I decided to go back to a Microsoft ergonomic and settled on this one.
There are nice touches, such as the scroll knob in the middle of the keyboard and the padded palm rest.
But the keyboard itself has a cheap feel to it (much cheaper than the Dell keyboard I was using) and the keys are a bit mushy...

B) It's a little bit of a hassle to return to Amazon just because I have to head out to the UPS store.

The biggest drawback is the space bar. Maybe it needs a breaking in period but I have a feeling it'll just get worse.

01/12/12 - Just a quick update to my original review. I googled for ""microsoft 4000 keyboard space bar"" and there are a LOT of reports of this issue out there. Not sure why Microsoft hasn't fixed it yet. At any rate, here's what worked for me.
If you pop off the space bar there are a couple of tiny triangular tabs - one underneath the 'N' key and one underneath the 'B' key. The one under the 'N' key was broken and hanging on. As many commenters in my search recommended, I removed it and cut off the one under the B key as well. This has helped the space bar a lot, though it's not perfect. It's definitely much better now.

10/16/12 - A couple of months ago I gave up on this keyboard entirely. The noise that the space bar makes was driving me nuts.

But ergonomic keyboards opened a whole new world for me. Thanks to Microsoft's efforts in this field, I have been using these ergo-boards from MS since they were first introduced. And while I had grown found of the wireless variety, I realized that I rarely ventured far from the computer with the keyboard, and craved the immediacy of operation that a USB keyboard offers, plus the price was about half of that of a wireless. I bought mine from Amazon on May 28th, and by September, the ""O"" key had stopped working. I called warranty support and was stunned when they told me they would gladly replace my keyboard--just as soon as I returned my defective unit at my own expense. What happened to the Microsoft that overnighted a replacement unit without even asking for the defective item in return. This was usually the case, though I have no problem returning defectives as long as I am reimbursed. So, now I have to make the choice to just whether to buy a ""Like New"" used keyboard for a little bit more than it will cost to ship this one, or just play Microsoft's game and send this back for a new one. Amazonians should note that this kind of behavior on the part of a company like Microsoft (and Logitech is moving in the same direction) serves to provide incentive to internet shoppers like myself to venture out into the real world. Had I purchased the item at a big box store, I could take it back without having to pay for return shipping, and that's that. But for Microsoft to add to the cost of a unit that is already defective and has cost me time and money in the process shows me just how much they care about the consumer. Zero. Because, after all, I could be running some kind of huge keyboard scam and making millions. Seriously, I can't give this keyboard a high rating when a key goes bad so soon. I have had that problem with the wireless version, but only after a few years usually. And MS ALWAYS sent me a new keyboard without question and without asking for the defective one to be returned. That kind of customer service won them my oyalty for years. It's amazing how quickly, however, that loyalty can be destroyed by shoddy, selfish, and utterly lacking customer support. This will be my last Microsoft keyboard. Fortunately I already own about a dozen that should hold me until they fall apart, one by one. Good customer service pays for itself.

I found I could only type fast (ie. touch type) the letters until I tried using a META/SHIFT key, number key or any other key aside from the usual unshifted alphabet letters.  I attributed this to the unusual wave design of the key layout which is supposed to promote stress free typing, which is does -- but while promoting a bad style of typing preventing the keyboard user from typing all other keys!  Hence, you're likely to use this keyboard for online irc chat rooms and quick chatting where you don't use anything but lower case letters!

I've recently purchased a Unicomp ""Customizer 104/105 (P/N UB4044A)"" mechanical (spring) keyboard along with a Leopold FC3456-A (brown switch) mechanical keyboard.  Although the Leopold brown switch keyboard I can type extremely fast, it's size and key layout is smaller causing numerous mistypes.  The Unicomp keyboard, I can type much better, but not as fast as the Leopold due to the stiffer springs while mistypes are much fewer.  I can also find finger/hand placement much easier and faster on the Unicomp board.  The Unicomp keyboard has a raised stepping for it's keys, providing more spacing for those of us with muscles in our hands.  Only gamers are going to like the smaller keybaords, as they can place the keyboard in their laps unlike those of use that work and need a desk for typing.

In brief, it took me weeks to relearn how to properly type so I could type numbers and other characters using META and Shift keys!  I don't think I'll ever buy another ergonomically styled key layout keyboard again!  I find it strange since we invented typewriters, the QWERTY keyboard has survived this long while the typewriter manufacturers never created an ""ergonomically styled typewriter""???  But all of a sudden the IBM style keyboards almost disappeared and replaced with these plastic switch keyboards.  (Sorry for the lack of clarity within the last couple of sentences, but the thought is there, it's just not described very well. :-/)

Anyways, I'm more privy to use the Unicomp keyboard when using VIM and will save the Leopold for typing very long reports.

As for these Microsoft keyboards, they really good for the price, but beware you'll take several weeks to learn how to type on them and then once you grow tired of them after a year, you'll need to relearn how to type for several weeks on another style of keyboard.  My advice, stick with the IBM Model M layout.  They've been around for a long time, likely for a reason!

2013.01.08: If you type a lot, then try buying a keyboard with softer keys, allowing easy touch-typing.  A good option I'm liking, except for the smallness or the ""less then actual size keyboard or typewriters"", are the Leopold keyboards (ie. Model FC3456-A). Keys seem closer together then the above Unicomp IBM Model M keyboard, and my fingers are far from being fat! These smaller keyboards seem to be great for little kid hands/fingers.  However, I can at least touch type compared to using the stiffer keys of the Unicomp keyboard.","OK Keyboard, but promotes BAD typing skills!",1321056000,

While my keyboards work decently, I was overcome with problems; the mechanical M1 keyboard was a poor keyboard for typing (the feeling was off and I was making an abnormal amount of typos) and my basic Logitech keyboard, a membrane kind, started off nicely but turned rather crappy as time went on.  It was time for a new keyboard.

I was in a pinch between going after a new mechanical keyboard or an ergonomic one (you can have both, but the cost is prohibitive).  After some thought, I went with a cheaper route and for this keyboard.  Upon opening it, it looked great; sure, it wasn't PS/2 compatible, but the wrist support was superb. Build quality was great throughout, although it's no mechanical keyboard.  It was wonderful to put my hands on the wristpad (which was lightly padded and covered with faux leather--it's really better than it sounds), ready to type.

Then I began typing.

Problems began to surface.  The keys were too stiff; I don't remember any keyboards that required break-in periods. They are usually shipped new and that's the best condition for the keyboards; it goes downhill as they age.  The keyboard layout, I could nitpick about, but seeing as it's an ergonomic keyboard, there's no reason to (it's probably better to adapt than to whine about it).  The dealbreaker, though, is the spacebar.

It's an ill-conceived, ill-designed, ill-manufactured piece of junk.  Not only is the force required to type with it high, it often refuses to be pressed. Sometimes it gets stuck. Overall, whatever good thing I had to say about the keyboard, the godforsaken spacebar tosses it out the window.

I should've listened to the online reviews and pass up the opportunity to get this keyboard.

I don't mind a little noise, personally, and I can't imagine anyone around you being distracted or annoyed by the relatively minor clicking.

However, if you buy this keyboard, BEWARE THE 'FUNCTION LOCK' BUTTON, which might quite possibly be the dumbest idea ever. Let me explain with an example:

You're using Excel, but unbeknownst to you the 'function lock' key is enabled, which is similar to locking down the shift key. However, unlike caps lock (which locks down the shift key as well), you can't tell the 'shift' key is actually locked down because the letters you type appear as lower case. However, when you go to edit a cell and press F2, your most recent edit disappears. WHY? Because the function lock key treats a press of F2 like you pressed both SHIFT+F2.

>> Shift+F2 is the 'undo' button...and you have no idea what's happening if you accidentally pressed the 'function lock' key as I did.

Annoying? Absolutely. So annoying that I damn near broke this thing in frustration trying to figure out what the hell was wrong.

I work with numbers so the four keys that are above the numeric keyboard are very useful for me, as well as the calculator button.

Of all these keyboards, this is easily the most comfortable I've used. Everything about the keyboard helps to keep my hands and wrists straight, from the ergonomic shape and split, to the front riser that elevates the front of the keyboard, and to the awesomely comfortable pleather wrist rest.

The large collection of ""utility"" keys is also a welcome addition, and the Zoom slider is a godsend. Seriously, ctrl+ is annoying.

The typing feel is alright. The keys are extremely soft and quiet and make virtually no ""click"". To some, this lack of feedback may be detrimental. At least there is virtually no flex, even with heavy typing strokes. The stroke length is pretty standard for a desktop keyboard, although I do wish it was a bit shorter like on the shallower keyboards I've used. As others have pointed out, the spacebar can indeed be hard to depress. Perhaps due to it's ""U"" shape, you have to hit it straight down or it won't budge.

For just about $10 more than the Comfort Curve 2000, I would wholly recommend this, unless you needed a smaller, more portable keyboard","Ridiculously comfortable, yet so cheap",1314403200,

Suffice to say my keyboards get a LOT of use, at speeds above 100 wpm, utilizing all the symbols and special keys.

I've been just using whatever keyboard I could find or was given, but just decided I need to get a good keyboard. I've had a couple minor wrist problems but nothing chronic, so I just felt like I needed an actually decent keyboard since it is something I use 100% of the time I'm at my computer.

I did my research and ended up choosing this one at the advice of other programmer reviews of it (e.g. Coding Horror). Everything about it is standard, which is absolutely critical to me: the backspace key is double-wide, the modifier keys are in the standard Ctrl-Win-Alt order, escape key is inline with function keys, insert/delete/home/end are normal size and layout. The extra buttons on the keyboard are nice, though I seldom use them and wouldn't miss them if this was just a standard keyboard.

The ergonomics of the keyboard are nice. I like the prop thing that comes with it and haven't removed it. The wrist rests are very soft and comfortable. The split layout doesn't take any time to get accustomed with; I just type like I normally do and my fingers are still hitting the right keys despite my hands being spread apart.

I don't prefer the feel of the keys; they have more of a mushy feel to them than I'm used to. But it's perfectly tolerable, given all the rest of the features of this keyboard, and I understand that every keyboard has a different feel. It's not difficult to type on, just different from what I'm used to.

The build quality is acceptable; the soft wrist pad feels very good quality, but the rest of the keyboard seems pretty mediocre. I suppose this is how they managed to get so much keyboard in so little price - I'm not saying it's not durable, it just doesn't feel expensive. No fancy aluminum here.

It's totally cross platform! I've already used it on both Windows 7 and OS X Lion, and in both cases I had a very good experience. I downloaded and installed the software from Microsoft's website, ignoring the included CD, before plugging in the keyboard. In Windows, the keyboard works exactly as expected - and as it should, given it's a Microsoft keyboard. In Mac, it was recognized immediately and the keys default to the mapping familiar with Mac users; so where Mac keyboards have the order Control-Option-Command, this keyboard too takes on that order (""Ctrl"" = control, ""windows"" = alt/option, ""alt"" = command). The special keys also work as expected by default, and are totally configurable in a prefpane in System Preferences. I was very pleasantly surprised at the quality of this Mac driver.

Overall, I love the keyboard and will be recommending it to anyone who is in the market for a keyboard! It even looks to be perfectly good for gaming - I'll need to test that. :)",Best keyboard I could find!,1313625600,

Salsbury,"After getting tired of aches and pains associated with keyboard use, reading lots of great reviews about this keyboard, and finally getting a deal on one here, I gave it a shot.  For about a month, I used this as my primary keyboard.  Then, I happily unplugged it and am hoping now to find it a new home.

I could handle the sheer bulk of it, though I didn't care for it.  I even got used to the fact that I often mistyped things (I use a sort of modified touch typing method where the finger closest to the key in question hits it rather than the ""right"" finger) because of the curved layout.

What I couldn't get used to was the feeling that I needed to reach down into the keyboard (because of the length wrist rest) and pound the keys to get them to register.  The space bar was especially problematic. I couldn't just ""tap it"".  I had to whack it pretty hard, and even then it often didn't register. I ended up going from a touch typist who didn't have to look at the keyboard often to someone who had to keep staring at the keyboard to figure out where the heck some of the keys were or why I kept getting a B when I wanted an N.

It may have helped shoulder and wrist pain a bit, but it caused my fingers to hurt terribly from having to hit the keys harder than I liked.

Apart from those complaints, the keyboard worked as designed, required no special installation effort on Windows 7 x64, and the various little extra buttons all did what they were supposed to do.

For now, I've gone back to my Logitech G15 which isn't ideal but suits me a lot more than this one did.",Stiff keys that don't register so well,1301356800,

It's at least 3 inches wider (and a lot bulkier) than my old standard Dell keyboard, not counting the wrist pad or elevating stand. That's a good thing, as it's solid and stays in place, but it also takes up a lot of space. Just from the way it's designed, this isn't the kind of keyboard you can just quickly tap single letters on; you have to put both hands in the correct position or it just feels weird.

The keys feel nice and are pretty quiet. You do have to move your fingers quite far for some letters though (y and b are too far from j and f), and the space bar feels a bit squishy. I like that you can create your own shortcuts for each of the top function keys, and the zoom and back/forward buttons are nice to have (though the back/forward buttons are too far down and my mouse already has those).

I can see how the key labels can wear off; they're decals, not etched on. The wrist pad feels nice but picks up debris really easily. Also, my stand is lopsided when I have the legs extended. I put a mousepad under one of the legs to compensate, but it still makes a creaking sound at times.

All in all, it's a nice keyboard for the money (especially given the limited...or nonexistent...selection at retail stores), if you can get past its issues and take the time to get used to it. I haven't noticed an improvement in my typing speed yet, but with practice...

I have one at home and one at work. And one non-functioning one on the shelf that was the victim of a water spill (unfortunately, no keyboard seems to be immune from liquid damage). I'll keep using one of these as long as they are around for me to use.

The layout is great. It takes an hour or so to get used to it, but once you do, you'll find your typing speed and accuracy both increase. If you have pain in your hands, you'll find that this doesn't exacerbate it like other keyboards might. It's as easy as any keyboard to install, and I haven't had any problem with it working outside of the one I ruined by spilling water on it. Keys responds well, they don't need you to hammer on them, in fact you can type pretty gingerly on it.

The ""candy"" on the keyboard isn't very functional to me, beyond the back-forward buttons near the space bar...I actually set those to skip through my music playlist. Love that feature! The zoom toggle in the middle...I reprogrammed that to be a scroll. I still don't use it all that often. I use the music controls at the top, and the calculator...but I don't really care about the shortcut keys.

I love the layout, though, and finding true ergonomic keyboards is becoming harder to do, what with Logitec bailing out completely, along with many other vendors.

So I make do with my Brother P-Touch label maker's little tags replacing the worn paint.  But these only last a week or so, before needing replacement.

I suppose I could purchase from a local vendor, then return it within their trial period for a replacement, and keep this up until Microsoft starts paying attention to quality control...

I'm giving it only two stars because of the many flaws I found while it worked:

1. Keys fade quickly. In about 2 or 3 months tops, the imprint on the most frequently used keys will disappear completely. This is normally a non-issue for experienced typists, but since I work with Unix consoles most of the time, remembering where the pipe or the backlash is was infuriating. Not to mention the fact that it should not happen on a ""premium"" product.

2. Space bar gets stuck. This happened mostly when the keyboard was new. After about a month or so the key loosened a bit and rarely got stuck again, but probably my fingers started remembering where to press on it to avoid that too. Sometimes it still got stiff as if the spring went bad.

3. Two drops of liquid were enough to kill it. Obviously you should not get a keyboard near any liquids, but everybody do it all the time and usually they can handle a bit of moisture. Well, not this one. I took it apart to see why it stopped working and I was surprised to see that the plastic ""floor"" under the keys is not a single piece, but actually has lots of cracks and holes by design, and they give direct access to the electronics to anything you may throw in there by accident.

I've spent the better part of the last 15 years of my life in front of a computer. I find that entirely depressing for the most part, but it's true.

I started using this keyboard during the management phase of my time at the web hosting company, and... wow. It really made a huge difference in my comfort level sitting at the desk. I had begun to develop a bit of carpel tunnel, tingling in my wrist and fingers, etc; after buying this keyboard, it all went away. I'm not suggesting that will be everyone's experience, just that it is my own.

I've owned a whole lot of keyboards, and this is easily the best that I've ever used. It's rock solid, has perfectly sized keys and a nice, soft wrist rest built-in.

I almost never use the short-cut keys at the top; just never got in the habit. They work, though, for the record.

Let's face it there is nothing sexy or even new about keyboard design, expect for the rise of backlit units.  But the keyboard is one of the most essential parts of the computer; after all, without one the computer is close to useless.

I loved, loved, loved the feel and sound of the old IBM keyboards, but those old white units are hard to come by these days.  The white and black squares clicked and related a fair amount of feedback through the keys.  They keyboard on my HP Pavilion dv9000 approximates the feel and of the old IBM's but not the sound, but I like the keyboard nonetheless.

The keyboard that ship with most dell desktop computers, like to one I use at work, are nice units, but they are almost too small for prolonged typing.  There is nowhere to rest the wrists while typing and that promotes fatigue with prolonged use, at least for me.  And over time, my left wrist will start to hurt.

So the search has been on for quite some time for the perfect ergonomic keyboard; one that feels good underneath the fingers (provides feedback), provides adequate space for the wrists, while also preventing the dreaded wrist ailment c-tunnel syndrome.

I've tried quite a few keyboards over the years so it was time to give Microsoft a try.  The ""Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000"" almost delivers.

The 411

Microsoft says of the Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 ""has been expertly crafted to allow you to work in a more natural position. The new Gull Wing design features a 14-degree gable, a natural arc and a curved key bed - bringing the keys closer to your fingers to reduce reach and unnecessary motion, while encouraging a more natural typing position. It also comes equipped with an optional palm lift for a seven-degree reverse slope and a cushioned wrist rest that encourages better arm and wrist alignment.""

There are a myriad of silver special function keys throughout they keyboard face including a Zoom Slider that allows for the magnification of digital pictures, maps, etc.  There are also forward and back buttons designed for use with the Internet, as well as (5) customizable My Favorites Hot Keys that can be programmed to ""instantly open the programs, files, and Web pages you use the most.""

Situated on the upper left hand side of the keyboard are three shortcut keys (Web/Home, Search, and Mail), while next to the My Favorites Hot Keys you'll find the typical multi-media controls.  Like most modern keyboards the function keys pull double duty depending on whether or not the F-Lock key is activated.

With the F-Lock on, they perform their standard functions, however with the F-Lock off, the black keys execute a number of useful shortcuts, including save, print, undo/redo, and reply/forward/send for e-mail programs. An added bonus: the function keys are all labeled with their secondary functions.

Installation

I installed the ""Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000"" on a Dell DX4300 running Windows 7 Enterprise Edition.  The USB keyboard was recognized right away and all of the function keys worked without installing the included software.

First Impressions

The first thing I noticed--and I am sure any user would--about the ""Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000"" ($24.95 at Amazon.com) is that it's big!  But that is not necessarily a bad thing because the matt black keyboard had amble room for the wrists to rest while typing.  And the wrist rest are not made of hard plastic like most keyboards in this class; indeed the rests are cover in rubber giving the wrist a cushioned and comfortable place to rest.

I immediately removed the palm lift; talk about awkward! The palm lift made typing on the ""Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000"" a very difficult prospect.  Luckily it is easily removed.

It is quite evident that Microsoft did not take a page from IBM's keyboard design book when placing they keys on this keyboard; they are hard to push for the most part and give little to no feedback.  Needless to say I do not care for them.  And because of the ""gull-wing"" design of the keyboard typing on the unit can take some getting used to.  After a few hours of typing on the ""Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000"" I got used to the unique placement of the keys and I am happy to report that production is up!

Conclusion

Though the Microsoft ""Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000"" is certainly bigger than some of it contemporaries, that added space is well used.  I like the padded wrist rest, as well as the innumerable special function/programmable keys included in the design.

I do not, however, like the feel of the keys, and the gullwing design took some getting used to.

For one, it's huge and chews up a lot of desk space.  For another, typing on this keyboard is noisy.

On the other hand, it's a reliable keyboard and keeps working even with minor spills and desk-dust on it, plus the key action isn't bad.  I also have to admit that the hand position ergonomics are pretty decent, too, although I did find the tilt somewhat steep and I was clawing at the keys rather than touch-typing.  In addition, I think that except for media center and console-attached keyboards, they do best when wired, not wireless.  I have a Microsoft 6000 wireless on another system, and it is -constantly- dropping keystrokes, even though the receiver is mere inches from the keyboard itself.

By day I'm a software developer, by night an instructor at a local university.  I am typing for writing code, and typing my lecture notes, tests, slides, and feedback to students.  I basically live at a keyboard.  I have had previous Microsoft ergonomic keyboards, but this one is by far my favorite for a couple of different reasons.  The primary is that I can type pain free for long periods of time.

While I have one of these keyboards on my desktop at home, and one at work, I don't have one hooked up to my laptop, which is usually sitting on the couch.  It is when I'm using my laptop that I notice the benefits of this keyboard.  After typing on the laptop keyboard for 30-45 minutes, my wrists begin to hurt, and it's generally just not comfortable to type anymore.  Using this keyboard, I can type for hours at a time in complete comfort.

As for the setup, I have the riser on the front and the feet dropped in the back.  This is opposite what many (or most) people do with their keyboards.  I find that the setup allow me to properly use the wrist rest and keeps the keys in a neutral position, allowing me to type quickly and comfortably.

When I first got this keyboard, the setup seemed like the best choice, though the first 3-4 days of using it, I just couldn't get comfortable, then suddenly something snapped (figuratively), and it all the sudden felt extremely comfortable, and natural.  For those of you who buy this and are thinking about returning it after a couple days, give it a week or more to actually try it out.

There are a few thing I don't like about this keyboard, but none of them take off anything from my review, because this is a keyboard.  The primary functions work perfectly.  That being said, the list of things I don't like: The zoom button (never use it, no need), the back/forward buttons, the media buttons (web/home, search, mail, and the macro buttons), never get used.  That being said, Play, volume and mute are often used, and I love them.  The calculator button is also a big win in my book.

How do I know this keyboard is a win?  While work provides us with ergonomic keyboards, they are often not very good ones, which is why I originally bought this one.  After a couple of weeks of use, 3 of my coworkers bought their own, now, 2/3 of the department uses them.

A couple final thoughts.  I have been using this keyboard for 4 years now, and haven't had a reason to consider anything else.  The number are still printed on the keys, I've dropped enough food in it to feed a small cat, and it still functions, I've spilled water on it and it still works (and cleaned out most of the food).

A keyboard (along with a mouse) are how we interface with a computer, and if that is comfortable, you won't do it.  This keyboard is comfortable.  While the split layout may be intimidating at first, it is really an ideal approach to typing, and I highly recommend you give this keyboard a spin.  It's worked great for me for 4 years.","The best keyboard I have ever used, period.",1292198400,

In general this is a great keyboard, except for the fact that Microsoft, like most other keyboard manufacturers now, uses cheap decals on the keys instead of indented and painted key  letters and numbers. A fairly large number of these decals (the most used keys, of course) wore off within months, on my first keyboard. I am a touch typist, so this problem isn't as serious for me as it would be for someone who doesn't touch type, by the way.

And the space bar is a little loud, I agree with the other complaints about this problem, but I'm not sure it needs to be split, although the length of the bar does seem perhaps to be contributing to the noise issue.  For sure, the space bar needs to be quieter and somewhat easier to activate.  Otherwise, the ergonomic layout and performance of this keyboard is very good.

The first one I got for my office at work, and the second for my office at home.  One I love and one I hate.  There is clearly a problem with Microsoft's quality control with these keyboards.

First off, I've been a user of the Microsoft Natural Keyboard Pro for years -- they are no longer available, and I bought five of them when the product was discontinued years ago.  I'm down to my last two somewhat clean keyboards.  The main thing I've been looking for in a new ergonomic keyboard is the correct setup for the arrow keys, with left, down, and right in a straight row, and up right above down (follow that?).  The 4000 has that, plus the curved split keyboard that I have really come to love.

The 4000 I have at work, the first one I got, is great.  All the keys have a fairly consistent feel and are quiet.  I preferred the utility button layout of the older Natural Keyboard Pro, and rather wish the function keys had their normal functions on the top (F1, F2, etc.) rather than the ""make it easy"" labels which only work on some programs, but otherwise, it's a perfectly adequate replacement.

The one I got more recently at home has one of the problematic spacebars.  It's LOUD.  If all the keys were this loud, it wouldn't be a problem, but it's very annoying and distracting to be typing and have a very loud slam/click every time I hit a space.  I pulled the spacebar key off a few times and tried to fix it, so far to no avail.  Finally I unplugged the new keyboard and went back to one of my remaining Natural Keyboard Pro copies.

It's hard for me to believe that computer keyboards have been around for more than 40 years and yet they still can't get such a simple thing right.

I have other keyboards: two that came with two HP PCs and a Logitech one purchased separately.  Now that I am used to the MS wide, curved layout I feel cramped using those.  With regular keyboards my arms feel as if plastered to my sides and quite cramped.  The Logitech keyboard is nice because it wireless but it doesn't match up to the MS keyboard in terms of comfort.

I am still giving the MS keyboard 4 (up from 3) stars.  If it retained the ink on its keys and was wireless it would be darn near perfect.

First update -------- I am updating this review since Microsoft replaced the keyboard and I am both surprised (!) and happy that they did.  I tried placing stickers on the keys and then writing on them but that didn't work.  I will take the advice from another reviewer about using nail polish on the keys to keep the letters from disappearing.  I think keyboards should last longer than this but Microsoft did stand behind their product so kudos for that service.

I do not know what is happening to keyboards but so many of them seem fragile and poorly made.  My Dell laptop has keys that literally broke.  The plastic piece that attaches the key to the board broke on two keys.  The keyboards that came with a new HP computer were so awful that I threw them away in favor of the Microsoft one.  I am now trying a Logitech keyboard to see if someone can make a keyboard that works for at least a year.

Original review ------ I can imagine that this is a good keyboard from an ergonomic perspective.  It has a very different feel from the standard flat keyboard and it takes up much more space as well.  It takes a good long while to get used to it but it is comfortable.

The reason I would like to give it negative stars is that the printing on the keys is disappearing with less than 6 months of use.  OK, I know my keyboard layout but this is ridiculous.  Just for comparison's sake, I have a very standard beige keyboard that has keys in almost as bad a condition as this one.  That keyboard is 10 years old.

On the Microsoft keyboard the E and R are almost completely gone and the I, K and S are close behind.  I do not know if this is a function of whatever they are using to put white print on black keys or just cheap junk manufacturing.

As for this keyboard in particular, there are good and bad things, but overall this is one of the best keyboards I've used.

The good:

1) As many have pointed out, the keys have the appropriate amount of spring to them, not too hard to push and very responsive.  And they're also very quiet.

2) The extra buttons can be programmed, even on a Mac, if you download the Intellitype software from Microsoft.  Very handy!

3) Very durable. I've typed a LOT over the last few years and it's still going strong.  All the keys continue to work properly.

The bad:

1) The first one I received had a ""sticky"" space bar, similar to the problem other reviewers have faced.  Initially I removed it and tried to modify it, but I ended up getting a free replacement directly from Microsoft, and it works great.  They didn't ask for the defective one back.

At first I really hated the keyboard. I really didn't like how the keyboard split up, but my wrist was hurting, so I needed an ergonomic keyboard. Out of the box, the space bar was stuck, and was really hard to push down as I type. However, after about a week of usage, it loosen and you're able to type at normal speed without consciously pushing the space bar down harder.

Keep the Plastic Attachment intact by the wrist pad:
I kept the plastic attachment by the pad which makes the keyboard slanted towards the front and elevated by the wrist.  It may look a bit weird at first but once you get used to it works to your benefit.

Customer Service:
Microsoft Customer Service was surprisingly good. One of the keys stopped working for the one I use at work.  I called support and soon they sent me a replacement keyboard.  I didn't have to send the old one back.

Other concerns:
One word of caution, key labeling seems to vanish after continuous use.  Another colleague had similar problem and Microsoft sent him a replacement.

Features:
There are some programmable hot-keys around the top of the key-board. One may find these helpful along with the Zoom key in the middle. I personally only use the zoom key among all of these extra buttons and even at a very minimum.

I owned an early model of the ergonomic key board that did not have all the bells-and-whistles of the 4000 model. I do know how to type, but I am not overly fast when typing. However because of the way the 4000 key board is set up I find that it is the most comfortable key board I have ever used. The key board has a pad to rest my wrists upon when typing. In addition, the front of the key board is elevated while the back of the key board is at a lower elevation than the front. This causes my hands to tilt downward to the key board when typing. This positioning of the key board is far more comfortable than my previous ergonomic key board. The MS 4000 key board comes with hot keys to perform a number of different functions and I have enjoyed using them, but it is the comfort of typing that I have enjoyed the most when using the key board.
 Before I ordered this key board from Amazon.com I thoroughly read all the reviews for this item. I was concern about the complaint that the space key did not work properly. The complaint was that when pressing the space key extra force/pressure was needed to make the key function. I have not had this problem at all. However, I have large hands and my thumbs sit right at the middle of the space key when my wrists are sitting on the key pad to type. I have not had to use any additional pressure on the space key and it functions perfectly for me. I am satisfied with the key board and would purchase another one if needed. I gave this key board a rating of 4 stars and not 5 stars because I have only been using it for almost 3 months. After a year if everything is still working as well, I would change the rating from 4 stars to 5 stars.",Satisfied with the key board,1266364800,

Pros

Easy to use.
It has a lot of keys.
It is pretty good looking, it has a great palm rest support and it is also pretty sturdy.
Great Windows 7 support, just plug and play.

Cons.
Space bar makes a lot of sound when pressed. (not too much but i kinda don't like it)
Despite the fact that it comes with multimedia keys, it lacks the buttons for previous and next track, so it's a little annoying, there is a work around to assign them to one of the 5 ""favorites keys"", but you have to do a little Windows registry hack.
Sometimes the extra keys lag a little while when you first pressed them, it disappears right after you press another key or the same one, I think it's a known issue of the Microsoft Intellitype software, I hope they fix it someday.

I've been using Microsoft Natural keyboards since they came out in the early/mid 90's, back when they cost nearly six times as much money. And, as the price has gone down on the ""regular"" Natural keyboards, so has the quality. With the 4000, I knew it was a step up, and I very much preferred the faux leather wrist rest over the plastic one on the standard Natural keyboard, so I didn't consider any alternatives.

I noticed that the price I got on the 4000 was pretty stellar, and hadn't given it much more thought until the keyboard arrived. Sadly, Microsoft has chosen to make the 4000 flimsier and less responsive than older models. The very first thing I noticed was that the Windows key on the new keyboards has a beveled logo (unlike my old 4000 keyboard, which looks like the one in Amazon's picture). I thought this was to unify their branding with the Vista and Windows 7 logos, but didn't realize that this was now a decent identifier of ""new"" keyboards.

The newer 4000's feel really cheap. Key travel isn't remotely as smooth as in the previous generation, and I'd go as far as to say that it isn't as good as a basic Natural keyboard. The mechanisms don't seem to be built for larger keys, so you have to find sweet spots in keys like CTRL and the space bar, or else you're just bending plastic without registering a keystroke.

On Windows, not surprisingly, plugging in the keyboard is all you need to do. You can install the Intellitype software, but it doesn't do much beyond adding a few icons throughout the OS and extend macro capability. On OS X, IntelliType is required if you want to swap the CTRL, ALT, and Windows keys to represent CTRL, Option, and Command keys on a standard Mac keyboard. The included software works fine on Snow Leopard and the default action is to swap the keys for you. Unfortunately, the software requires a reboot, and they haven't quite figured out 64-bit control panel objects in OS X.

If I had it to do over again, I'd probably go to a bricks-and-mortar store and see if I could score myself an older 4000. Similarly, I'd gladly pay more money to have the quality of the old 4000 back. Microsoft ruined a once-wonderful keyboard (again!) to move more units.

As a software developer, the keyboard is the single most important component on my PC, and I've tried most of the ""big"" and common ones: Cherry G81 and G83, das Keyboard, Logitech G-15. But the Microsoft 4000 was not only love at first sight, it is still love to this day. It's one of the few remaining ergonomic keyboards, and I think it's the one that really works. The tile angle is just perfect and the integrated palmrest really shines. It's not just an attachment and not made of plastic, but it's permanently attached and has a soft material so that together with a proper office chair with armrests, you can really place your hands ergonomically.

The keys also have a good hub/resistance, so they really give good tactile feedback and are not too noisy. One problem that the 4000 has is the space bar. On some models, it is very stiff or has to be hit almost exactly in the center. To my knowledge, the only fix to that is to permanently replace it or learn to live with it. My 2007 keyboard has that problem, but the one I bought 2 weeks ago (Jan 2010) has a perfectly working space bar, so I do not know if this is still an issue.

I don't care too much about the extra keys on the keyboard, except the volume control which is important for me. Also, the keyboard came with a ""bar"" that lifts it's front up so that the keyboard is tilted down. Not too sure what this is good for, I removed it immediately as it was a rather uncomfortable experience, but YMMV.

Webb,"This keyboard is great in theory, but the first one I got from Amazon had the ""crazy hard to push"" space bar problem.  You literally could not push the space bar down except when pushing right on the center of it.  You could nearly put all your weight on the extreme left or right sides, and nothing would happen!  Seriously!  After typing for 4-6 hours with that (and re-training myself to hit the space bar in the middle), my arms were very sore and I went back to my slightly broken Goldtouch keyboard.  I disagree with other reviewers who say this is a ""feature"" and that you should press the space bar in the middle for ergonomic reasons.  Bullocks!  The less you have to stretch and strain the better for ergonomics.

I returned the first keyboard to Amazon, but I still needed a new keyboard, and the 4000 seemed to be about the only non-wireless, decently ergonomic keyboard out there.  I was at the local office supplies store, and they had the 4000 on display, and its space bar was very easy to push; so I picked one up (albeit for $50).  When I got out to the parking lot I took it out of the box to find that they space bar was indeed much better than the one I got from Amazon, but still has problems on the extreme top left and top right sides of the space bar.

For now I'm sticking with the second 4000 keyboard, it works fine for me.  The space bar is still a little stiff and noisy, but the other keys are awesome.  I think the space bar will break in as well, as the display model had no space bar issues.  My guess is that the one I got from amazon was just a dud, perhaps if I exchanged it the second one would have been acceptable.

As with all ergonomic designs, it takes a few days to get used to it, and people who don't touch type probably won't care for it. However, I started using one of the original Microsoft Natural Keyboards in 1995, and as a writer I think it's one of the best decisions I ever made. I've never had the first trace of carpal tunnel stress.

This model is wired with a USB plug, and after trying some wireless ergonomic keyboards, I came back to the wired version. The wire is a minor annoyance, and having to change batteries in the wireless version is a bigger one.

The layout is fine, with one major objection. All later versions of the Microsoft ergonomic line change the way functions keys are used in a very stupid way. People who need ergonomic keyboards are generally quite familiar with Ctrl-X, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V, Ctrl-Z and other shortcuts for common operations (Cut, Copy, Paste, and Undo for the four listed). The new arrangement for function keys duplicates those operations on the function keys, but you have to remove your hand from the keyboard to get to them, which is vastly inferior. Plus, that's the default when the keyboard is turned on, and so if you are accustomed to using some function key operations in programs such as Microsoft Word, you have to press the F Lock key to switch the functions keys back to normal usage. That would be fine, except that when you do that, the PrtScn no longer works until you press F Lock again to switch back to default mode. Fixing this annoyance requires first installing Intellitype (which you can download from Microsoft), and then doing a patch to remap keys, which is available on the web. I can't put links in product reviews, but I can tell you that the search you want is ""F Lock Key Eliminator"".

The other major issue with this model is reliability. I'm getting less than two years of usage out of each one, and that's not full time because I move from computer to computer depending on what I'm doing. I got one with a bad space bar that never did work quite right. Two others have failed with keys that just stop working or become intermittent. It's possible that this comes from build up of dust and detritus in the keyboard - my office is dusty and I'm not fastiduous about cleaning the keyboard. But it didn't happen with my older models.

However, these little guys are pretty cheap, so I've just been keeping one in reserve at all times and ordering another when one fails. It's worth it to me to get the smooth action and nice ergonomic layout.

A few miscellaneous notes: the keyboard has play/pause and volume up-down keys for media, but nothing to advance media as some of the other Microsoft keyboards have. Instead it has five programmable keys, but if there's a way to make them work as for media forward/back I have not found it. There are also dedicated keys for bringing up a browser to your home page, and for search, email, and calculator. Finally, there's a handy mute key to silence your speakers, and I love having that to silence things when I get a phone call. The dedicated keys can be reprogrammed to other functions with Intellitype. Finally, the keyboard has back and forward buttons beneath the space bar where you can thumb them, and a zoom slider in the middle (between the separated banks of keys) but if it works with any piece of software I've ever owned, I have not been able to detect it. You might as well pretend it's not there.

Petric,"This is the best designed keyboard by Micro$oft since Natural Internet keyboard. For a time after they did away with that design, all they had available was the Natural Keyboard Elite, which totally sucks. The other complaint in their designs was the redesigned placement of the Insert/Home/Pgup/PgDwn area, where the keys were designed in a vertical arrangement. Not to mention the arrow keys were often placed in a cross pattern, instead of the standard old school inverted T. Having worked for Microsoft in the past, I can tell you that sometimes people there over-think things to the point that they think they can reinvent the wheel! I'm sure many of you who work in a corporate environment are familiar with these people. :)

Anyway -

This beautifully designed keyboard appeared on the market a couple of years ago! I've loved most everything about this ting since day one. The keys are the soft, easy, and smooth depression type, the re-designed curvature of the key layout of the major keys is quite an improvement! And feel infinitely better on my hands and fingers. I am also somewhat picky about the looks as well and MS did not disappoint here either. Its sexy black with silver programmable and function keys at the top rock! And they restored the aforementioned insert/home keys to normal placement! Wonderful!

The only improvement they could make IMHO would be to drop the F Lock function all together. This function turns the F1 through F12 keys into Office functions. Anyone who seriously uses their or anyone's office suites, should already know these functions by use of regular hot keys. Though don't fret this all together, at least the F Lock key is off by default, making it less annoying. In short, I view this as a worthless function to their keyboards.

I run a small IT/Consulting (sometimes insulting)/Systems Administration company. I have sold these to clients who prefer the natural design and have heard nothing but rave reviews from them.

For those thinking of making the leap from a standard design keyboard to a natural, I offer this advice... The biggest thing you will have problems with at first is the adjusted reach to keys, because they are positioned differently. If you are serious, give yourself some time getting used to this design. Some do make the trtansition rather quickly, and some folks never do like it. Its well worth the old collage try to see if you can make the leap. :)

I was ready to be disappointed because of the various reviews that I read, but I have to say that I don't agree with any of them, at least no 100%.

I've heard rumors of the keys being hard to press, which is all together untrue. I have had no issues pressing the keys whatsoever, and I've found them enjoyable. They aren't rough on my hands at all and I really don't see how they could be hard to press. The spacebar, however, does take some time to become accustomed to. Because of the curve of the keyboard it makes the spacebar hard to press because you're not really hitting it in the center and it's not balanced very well. I think this could have been solved with two separate keys for it. Although it is annoying, it is nothing that can't be over seen for the overall superb quality of the product.

I did find the installation of the software annoying. Like anyone else would do, I plugged in the keyboard and booted. Within moments I found that I couldn't type anything, but I had a log in password to type... I had to grab another keyboard and restart.

2348,B000A6PPOK,Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000,3.0,,False,"11 14, 2009",A477SZW855ZPD,{'Style:': ' Retail'},Fletch Hasues,"The Microsoft Natural 4000 excels at being a good standard use keyboard for ergonomics, but under the hood, it fails.  While I am impressed that Microsoft has realized that it was going in the wrong direction from the Microsoft Natural to the Natural Elite, there are other short comings that this and previous keyboards have had, and even more so, most of their periphial line.  If you plan on doing standard typing, development, office work, etc, this is a great keyboard.  However, just as the previous versions of the Natural, if you plan on using many keys simultaneously, this is not your keyboard.

  The Natural 4000 shines in that it is very comfortable as the wrist rest area has built in pads with a soft leatherette feel, the keys are quiet, and we see a return to the front riser which alleviates wrist strain due to it assisting in keeping your wrists straight.  This is important because if a keyboard is going to be truely ergonomic, it needs to focus on what it means to be ergonomic...give a split key design to reduce the outward flair of the wrists and also add a slight angle to accomodate the angle of which the hands must bend to come to the surface of the keyboard.  The Natural 4000, much like its first generation model meets this challenge, which is important if one studies the Natural Elite model which began the decline of following ergonomic design by removing the front reiser and most of the curvature that made this series of keyboards become as popular as it did.  The Natural also gets high marks in that the keys are quiet, they are arranged in the correct standard of 104 or so key layout, so if you are a developer, you know exactly where the keys are going to be (as far as special symbols, namely the ""|"" key, the arrow keys, and the ""Insert"", ""Delete"", etc) are in their correct locations.  This means that any typist can switch to this model and adapt quickly.  So many of the interesting models of ergonomic keyboards re-arrange the ""Insert"", ""Delete"", ""End"", etc keys that it makes the keyboard awkward.  Another common mistake is the keyboard vendors make the arrow keys awkward by moving the left and right arrow keys upward so that they are not aligned with the down arrow key as seen on the common standard.  While this is not a big deal to most people, it is if you plan on using this keyboard for playing games.  This keyboard comes with many media keys that allow you to do such things as start your music player, adjust your volume, start many popular programs including your web browser, etc.

  Stylistically speaking, the keyboard looks very sleek wth its black and gray design, and with curvature that both adds comfort and is asthetically appealing.  With the leatherette in the front, the soft glowing leds, and the extra meta keys, it reminds someone as if he or she has upgraded his or her keyboard to a sports car.  Microsoft gets high marks on the appearance of the device as it does look nice, and the black and gray goes well with the black and silver trends of most periphials and computers.  So, all in all if all this device is going to be used for is the office and development, one may ask what can go wrong.  The answer is, not much.

  However, this is a Microsoft periphial.  Traditionally, the keyboard lines have been okay in the realm of workmanship, however in the mice line, the units simply do not last.  Typically the mice stop responding to events, and simply wear out, which is sad seeing as opticals would seemingly last longer noting the reduction of moving parts.  Unfortunately, this has now crept into the keyboard line as well.  A good example, the Microsoft 2000 keyboard line have been noted for their cheap crafting which results in overall failure for the devices, and people simply discard them.  This has happened in under two years of use.  I'm seeing similar issues in the 4000.  At times, the K key sends an L keystroke as well.  Strange, but okay, just one key.  Then the function keys failed to work.  However there is an F lock key that should be checked, and is normal, but this simply isn't the case as the keys simply do not work.  While many people could argue that they do not use the function keys, in an office environment one most certainly does (how many times do you hit F3 to ""look for the search result again"" after searching for text in a text editor?  how many times do you use F5 for a refresh of a web browser?).  The biggest issue I have is the number of keys one can press at a time before the keyboard simply can't handle any more input.  This is extremely bad if you are a gamer.  First person shooters, one may be able to pull it off, but even the simplest games such as Continuum, or even old titles such as Interstate 76 where multiple keys will be pressed as you are holding one key down for movement, and another one for an action, it is probably headed for failure.  This may be a result of how the Microsoft keyboards handle the control key in their line.  This has been a problem for the Microsoft Natural, Microsoft Natural Elite, and the Microsoft Natural 4000 keyboards, so it is historical.  So if you are even considering a game, I would recommend keeping a cheap usb keyboard in your drawer and using it for gaming.

  The only final notes I can add for the Natural is noting the additional media keys, your mileage of going through a KVM to control multiple computers will vary.  Many KVM vendors will tell you that if you can not control your computer past POST and before boot, it is because the keyboard has too many keys and it is affecting the KVM.  However, I have noted that if keyboards have USB hubs on them, this tends to confuse KVMs in what information is being sent to the computer, so if you are using a KVM, do not plan on using any keyboard with a USB hub as most BIOS's can not handle them for the additional information that is sent that the protocol in the KVM doesn't support.  Also, the Natural 4000 works well with Linux (but again, not well from the Gaming perspective) as there are a few methods that can be used to allow use of the additional media keys.  This is a big plus again for people who want to do development as you can assign various useful events thus removing the need to grab the mouse.

All in all, the 4000 is a decent keyboard, but it is not the be-all end-all solution due to Microsoft not addressing the issues under the hood.  Some may say this coincides with the Microsoft philosophy, but that is for the user to decide.","Ergonomic dream, function disappointment",1258156800,

Also, occasionally the Function key modifier would get stuck off and the Function keys would no longer work. It was a really stupid feature to overload the function keys with yet another key. Even more stupid is to occasionally lose the user's setting on this key for no reason. So when I hit F6 or F5 to build or debug in Visual Studio, I would occasionally just get crickets ... nothing.

I love the feel of this keyboard and what it does - what I get it to fully work!

After three sessions with MICROSOFT TECH SUPPORT, I'm still plagued by the HOT KEYS (My Favs and keys along the left side) going out every 24 hours or when I reboot.

I found a work around for it:  I call up the keyboard (which keeps looking for software and gives me error messages).  After hitting cancel eight or nine times, the keyboard properties come up and I hit OK and those keys work again.

I was already a fan of the ""Natural Pro"" type keyboard because of its comfortable position.  This keyboard is even better because of the down slope of the keyboard.  If you get your chair and the board at the right height relationship you will find that there is no fatigue even if you are typing long documents for hours.  This is as good as I have ever used.

My only criticism is that the space bar makes too loud a noise when you are typing.  It is not loud enough to make me do anything but mention it.  The feel of the keys is just right.

I ended up going with this one since it had the padded wrist rest and had the option of raising the front end, which I thought would be novel.

After using it for a few days, I wouldn't have traded it for any keyboard in the world (not even the IBM clackers in the supply closet). The keys were responsive, the calculator key worked without installing additional drivers, and (most importantly) my wrist pain had faded away. I was totally hooked and have not purchased a non-ergonomic keyboard since.

I switched jobs last year and had to leave the 4000 behind since it was bought with company funds. I was supplied with the basic Microsoft ergonomic keyboard that has sold for $10 for years now. I just went with it since I'm a pragmatist at heart; it got the characters on the screen and my wrists didn't hurt. But after seeing the 4000 on a deal site for ~$30, I decided to regain the joy I had previously experienced.

When it arrived, I decided to give it a little trial at home. After half an hour or so, it seemed that the H, Y, and M keys did not register under normal pressure. I decided to take it to work anyway since I assumed my changed typing form was to blame. After using it for an entire work day, I was on the phone with the vendor (Amazon seller) telling them they needed to send me a replacement. We cross-shipped, and I got one with 100%-working keys. Finally, back to bliss, I thought.

After a week of using it at work, my wrist pain came back. I couldn't figure it out since I had used the same model keyboard in the same position (roughly) for a few years without problems at my last job. I initially looked at my mouse, but changing its position didn't help. Changed the height on my chair, how I sat, and other variables. As a last resort, I took the elevating attachment off the front. Within three days, the wrist pain was gone again.

Based on using an older unit for a few years and using one bought just months ago, I think the quality level has suffered. A friend also ordered one from the Amazon seller when I did, and he also had to return his first due to defective behavior. The key action seems a lot muddier than I remembered and is definitely slower/softer than the $10 beige wonder I'm typing on now. The space button squeaked rather loudly after using it for a few days, but a can of silicone took care of that.

This has found a place in my secondary office location. Nostalgia might cloud my judgment a little when comparing to my old unit, but for purely typing purposes right now, I prefer the basic ergonomic Microsoft offering to the 4000. If the additional function buttons and scroller appeal to you, you would probably be better off with the 4000.

You might look at other dates of other reviews; I would have given that older unit five stars plus, but the newer one gets three stars for the initial product and four after I removed the elevating attachment and took care of the squeaking.

Pros: ergonomic, several customizable function buttons, scroller in the middle, better home key layout, looks cool.

Cons: keys aren't as responsive as others, raised front might cause wrist problems for some.","Very good, but not perfect",1238371200,

Wooten,"Having been a fan and long user of previous model Microsoft Natural Ergo keyboards, I was glad to see this upgrade and enhancement. It had been a couple of years since using them, so it took a short time to find my way back to experiencing the true advantage of the key placements. Functionally, I am very pleased with this new model. I don't really like the size, but one must put up with such things to get the features that I do like.
On the down side, Microsoft is to be chided for their quality and cost-cutting on this very expensive keyboard. In my many years of professional and continuous keyboard usage, with very cheap to this top-end corded model, I have never experience the wiping out of the key lettering. This began to be noticed after only a couple of months usage. Now, not yet a year old, the ""D"" and ""C"" keys are almost complelely blank, and the ""S"" key is not far behind.

It took me a day or so to get used to the new layout, but after 3 days I was fully up to speed.

I have not had the problems with the spacebar that other reviewers mentioned, however I do sometimes have to go back and insert an ""n"" - I guess I don't hit that key quite hard enough for it to take all of the time.

My main issue is that some of the letters are wearing off already.  It doesn't bother me specifically, because I do touchtype, but I know it could be problematic for other people, and I'm surprised that they're wearing off so quickly - it took *years* for the same wear to show on previous keyboards.  (Keys affected are E, S, D and C.)  I do a lot of copy-paste via keyboard commands, so that might be partly to blame, but it's still not ideal for a keyboard.

That said, after 4 months of use it is still comfortable, curves naturally, and does not require too much pressure to get accurate typing (with the occasional exception of the ""n"", as mentioned before).  Overall I am happy with this keyboard and, if I had a desktop at home, would buy another one of these to use at home.

2 years later:  The keyboard finally died, but only because I spilled water on it.  Towards the end, most of the key labels had been rubbed off which didn't bother me at all but did confuse other people.  I had to use a regular keyboard for about a week while my replacement (same again!) came in.  I didn't realize how much I used the special function keys until they weren't available, and would probably pay for premium shipping next time to get a replacement quicker.  The only reason I docked a star was the letters wearing off, and that was more for other people than for me.  I'm extremely happy with my keyboard.",Comfortable and easy to use,1237161600,

I still had fond memories of my old MS NATURAL ELITE PRO keyboard I had used writing my Thesis, so I decided on the 4000 model which seemed to be its improved replacement. I have had the keyboard for about two months - here are my impressions:

THE GOOD:
- The 4000 is not just another beautiful keyboard but a REALLY comfortable one too. Not only are the curves natural and well molded but the minimally padded leather-imitation wrist-rest offers a silky sense of luxury. The keyboard comes out of the box with a negative angle attachment, which can easily be removed - it is comfortable but personally I need to see what I am typing.

- Compared to other Ergonomic keyboards, one has to note that unless the keys are physically separated into two groups any ergonomic effects will be minimal. So, if you are thinking of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Logitech-s-Wave/dp/B000UH8I66/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Logitech's Wave</a>, it is a good idea to actually give both of them a try at a local store before making a choice. As I said, I am no professional typist (yes, more of a 2-fingers) yet I found that my typing is much faster and my typos more rare when using Natural keyboards.

- I liked the idea of the BACK/FORWARD buttons at the wrist-rest. Although most mice now have this functions on their side buttons, it is still a big help when browsing (my mouse has a Magnifying Function where the FORWARD usually is).

- Also, this is a really quiet keyboard. You get a satisfactory feeling when pushing a button but instead of an annoying ""clack"" sound only a muted ""tap"" is heard. Ideal if your wife is in the habit of taking naps in your home-office couch.

- As an avid gamer favoring the right side of the keyboard (arrow keys instead of the WASD configuration) I enjoyed the ample room around the former.

- Finally, I liked the placement of an extra set of EQUAL, PARENTHESIS and BACKSPACE at the top right corner (especially the parenthesis, I always hated finding the opening and closing one among the numbers)

Now, THE BAD:
- For some reason the ENTER and RIGHT SHIFT keys are too small! I could do with regular sized ""H"" and ""N"" keys if it would mean not hunting the ENTER. And this is a large keyboard, I doubt it would make any difference if it was yet a bit longer for that.

- The SPACE bar is, well, fickle. Sometimes it works even if hit at the side. Others it refuses unless hit in the middle.

- The key letters and symbols have a tendency to rub off(!). This is totally unacceptable for a premium priced product - especially one sporting MICROSOFT's brand name. I decided to wait for the problem to become more pronounced and have this one replaced.

- The Media keys on top do not sit well in their homings and are not perfectly aligned. Especially the VOLUME UP in my keyboard seems to rest at an angle. Again, poor quality control for such an expensive and brand name product.

When you press it from left or right, it made a loud crack sound and was very hard to press. You need to press it in the center of it to make the space bar act likes a normal key instead of cheap one. I was going to return it and exchange it with another one because I though it was defected product.
  But I read a online review that this was normal and couldn't not be fix. But since I don't want to go though with mailing back the huge keyboard box with boxed in 2' by 3' box(amazon shipped with a huge brown box). I decided to keep it for a few day.
  I decided to reattach the raise keyboard stand below just to try it out. And it turned out that if you place your hand properly on the raised stand, this is the most comfortable typing style I have ever try it before. you need to put both of your two elbows on the table and type as if you would play with crystal ball like a gypsies.
  That the first improvement I noticed it and I decided to try it for a few more day. I am computer science student and because of my condition I need to use ergonomic wrist glove to type. Every since I found out that how to type properly on the raised stand, I don't need to wear that glove. Now that loud sound from space bar disappeared and space bar act likes rest of the keys. And I don't need to press hard when I press from left or right, it must have grease it self and it sort out itself.
 That is so cool! Before I buy this keyboard I was having hard time choosing between this one and Logitech wave keyboard. I took this for the raise stand I am glad I made that decision.

ergonomic keyboard- very comfortable which is paramount to all the bells and whistles of keyboards.

cons:
1. The space bar requires a bit more effort to press unless you press closer to its center but I doubt anything can be done about that as space bars in general encounter that problem however curved keyboards such as this one exacerbates the problem.

2. lack of multimedia key's- the volume control is nice, and the most important feature to me, and it even has a play/pause button but it would be nicer if it also had a fast forward, rewind, and stop button as well- those two were on the multimedia keyboard. They're extremely useful if you use itunes and come across a song you dislike and wish to skip over it without leaving your current window

3. zoom button- doesn't work, probably vista x64 fault

Namely, my fingers went numb in five minutes of playing! Mild carpal tunnel syndrome is the cause; not severe enough for treatment, but bad enough to make my fingers go numb.

Rather than quitting playing guitar, I decided to start by replacing my keyboard with a MS Natural Ergo Keyboard. And it has made all the difference in the world. Since I started using the keyboard, I have only had finger numbness once, and that was after prolonged driving rather than typing. I think it safe to say that this keyboard has completely solved my symptoms, without forcing me to quit music.

It has a nice comfortable built-in wrist rest, covered with comfortable leatherette. You can raise the front or the back of the keyboard with the supplied support, but I recommend raising the back (side closest to your belly). Between the support at the back, the downward angle between halves of the split keyboard, the outward cant of the keys, and the curved ""gull wing"" key positions, you will find your hands are held at totally natural and comfortable angles that totally avoid wrist stress. Since this is why most of us buy the keyboard, it does this job extremely well.

The keyboard itself is well thought-out, with keys to do every function you could ever want. The row of F keys across the top are dual-function like earlier models, but unlike earlier models the ""F lock"" now stays on between restarts. So, once you make the keys map to their standard F-key mapping, the keyboard remembers that setting. USUALLY. Occasionally the F-lock setting will reset: you know because you'll hit F-keys and the applications will start complaining that they don't recognize the command you're typing. To help with recognition of this situation, the ""locked"" lights are right down between your thumbs: Caps lock, scroll lock, num lock, and F lock.

It also has two interesting features between the halves of the keyboard: back/forward buttons and a ""Zoom"" slider. The back/forward buttons, which you click with your thumbs, work great for web page navigation, although I find sometimes the ""back"" button goes back more than one web page. The zoom slider, on the other hand, is totally worthless. It is inconsistently supported by applications, and not really very useful to start out with. Fortunately, the keyboard is fully programmable, and a little searching (google for Josh Highland's blog entry called ""hacking the Microsoft Natural Keyboard 4000"") discovered a handy script you can install to convert the useless ""zoom"" slider into a highly functional ""scroll"" slider. I love it. Now you don't have to keep going back to the mouse to scroll up and down pages.

There are also programmable keys at the top, including calculator, play/pause, no speaker, and ""My favorites."" I have not used many of these, but thankfully the web-oriented ones respect your default browser so you can use firefox instead of IE. They might be handy for some people.

One caution: when you plug it in, you will wonder how you will ever learn to type on it. You'll be convinced that somebody has applied a security device that keeps you from doing any work. Don't worry, you'll learn. The first day I had serious productivity problems; by the second working day, I was fine with it. I should note that if you are a fast typist but not a touch typist, you probably will have some problems. The only lingering problems I have are bad habits I had picked up over 30 years of programming such as sometimes reaching across to hit the ""Y"" with my left index finger.

Phillips,"I bought this primarily because I was having problems with my Saitek and my Vista x64 laptop. I figured that maybe a Microsoft keyboard that said ""Vista certified"" on the box might give me less problems. To be honest, I'd never really thought about the ergonomic aspect before.

My initial thoughts were that this keyboard seems very well made and sturdy. There is nothing about it that feels cheap - the plastic feels tough, the wrist rest feels soft but durable and they keys have an excellent travel and feel to them. I really appreciate the damped sound compared to my Saitek.

Next, I am impressed with the range of extra buttons on this keyboard - I never thought I'd use them, but I do. It actually is handy to have my browser, email, search and calculator right there. The zoom slider seems a little pointless, but horses for courses!

But what has impressed me most of all is the ergonomic design. They have obviously given a tremendous amount of thought and research into laying out these keys - and what a result! Never before have my hands felt like they were in such a natural position. Going back to my Saitek briefly I can't believe that I typed in that position for so long - it's no wonder I'd started to get pains in my wrists and forearms. This keyboard is comfortable with a capital ""C"". I really like the raised wrist position. It took me maybe an hour to get used to the angled key layout and I love it now. It's even ironed out a few of my bad typing habits, like constantly reaching over for the ""B"" key with my right hand - not possible on this layout.

Overall I am tremendously happy with this product and would recommend it to anyone who is prepared to try something new. My only worry is that I'm going to wince from now on whenever I have to use someone else's non-ergonomic keyboard...",Best keyboard yet,1214352000,

I bought this keyboard in October 2007 and within a month noticed that the letters on the frequently used keys were either gone or wearing off. I suspect it's because instead of the older (and more expensive) method of injection molding the symbols on the keys which makes them a permanent part of the key, they are now using the much cheaper method of using something like decals which is only a surface treatment and so rub off fairly quickly.

This seems to be a trend with all Microsoft hardware. Used to be they were always of high quality and durability, now-a-days they just seem cheap except for the prices they charge.

Product:
Microsoft natural ergonomic keyboard 4000 - advanced ergonomic design
Model:1048

Reasons:
1. It is not ergonomic design by any means
2. spacebar is hard to press when you actually type .
3. your fingers/wrist might experience pain if you use this; It happened to me.

you won't understand what i say if you simply try this keyboard in stores. you actually need to type a document using this and u will know why the keys make it hard to type. it is amount of pressure needed to type a key is different when u press them individually vs while typing a document when all fingers are in use.-

Don't know which ergonomic evaluator approved such wiered keyboard.

I would give it ZERO stars if I could.

1. split the space bar into two buttons to atleast make this keyboard usable.
2. reduce finger pressure required to press all keys specifically spacebar.

I'd recommend not installing the software that comes with it, and just forgo the ""zoom"" control and a couple other bells and whistles. If you want those, don't buy Microsoft.

Pluses:
Good touch, I'm a fast typist and even with my advancing arthritis, I haven't slowed much with this keyboard. On a 'straight' keyboard I can now only go about 20 wpm, here, I can do my old 50-70 wpm. Keys are about where you expect them to be, and even with a couple years' wear, this keyboard is holding up well. It really is good hardware.

Minuses:
Lots of crevices that catch junk. You need something like a playing card to periodically clean them.

Now the software: The software is a train wreck. It messes up the zoom settings and window scroll settings on my Dell dual-core laptop when it's undocked. Rebooting doesn't help. If you open an Excel sheet, it  immediately zooms to 400%. Unzoom it, and what the hey, it zooms right back to 400% again. Scroll bars act the same. Everything wants to be up at the top, regardless of where I set it. And if you have a Logitech mouse, it won't work right with Microsoft's software as it just installs itself over the top of anything you had previously configured perfectly.

Conclusion:
Good keyboard, very good hardware; but the software is invasive. Don't install the software. Thanks, Microsoft.

Why only 2 stars? Uninstalling Microsoft's software trashed my built-in laptop keyboard's drivers. (It disabled them!) So when I rebooted, I had NO keyboard at all!

I'm a business systems programmer and after a few years of crunching away on the keyboards that get thrown in with the computer, my fingers started to get some telltale aches.  This keyboard certainly did a good job of alleviating those aches - between the natural wrist and key angles and the soft, pliant action of the keys, the Ergo 4000 is a really comfortable keyboard to type on.  It was the finger equivalent going from a stiff high school desk chair to a Lay-Z-Boy.  You notice immediately that the (semi-satisfying) snap and sharp action of standard keyboard keys is replaced with a near-silent, soft feel.  The wrist support is also surprisingly comfortable, lined with some kind of soft rubber.  It might be different if you're used to a standard keyboard, but your fingers will thank you.  I also found the range of application and document launching shortcuts that line of the top of the keyboard quite handy, saving a little bit of mouse work.

I must say that after a year and a half of good service, my original Ergo became useless when a single letter stopped working.

I bought this keyboard hoping that it would relieve the strain placed on my wrists by typing. So far it has worked wonderfully. I can type on this keyboard for long periods of time without discomfort, whereas five minutes with a normal keyboard used to cause immense pain in my wrists.

My only complaint is that the spacebar was a lot firmer at first than I expected. It has become slightly easier to press with time, but not by much. This may only be the case for some of the keyboards, as the one that I played around with at the store (same model) seemed to have a looser spacebar.

Also, be aware that the keyboard is pretty tall (which is necessary for it to tilt slightly backward and be comfortable to use) and may not allow your keyboard tray to retract fully into the table. This slight inconvenience, however, is well worth the superior comfort that this keyboard provides for your wrists.

Edit (November 23, 2008):

I used this keyboard for a couple of months after buying it, but eventually my RSI got worse and I stopped using a computer altogether. I've recently begun to use a computer again under the supervision of a physical therapist, and the keyboard that I use is a Goldtouch Soft Touch keyboard (GTN0077-ST). This keyboard is better than the Microsoft 4000 in three ways: 1) The keys, including the space-bar, are much easier to press (requiring only 45 g of force); 2) The amount the keyboard is split and raised is adjustable; 3) There is no number pad which allows the mouse to be placed closer to the center (requiring less reaching and strain).","Very comfortable, but the spacebar takes a little getting used to",1200960000,

Davis,"I bought this keyboard with some reservation based on the comments of others re: the spacebar.  I concluded that I'd get used to it if it was really as bad as claimed (and I presumed that others were being a bit dramatic about the problem).

Well, to my surprise, it does take an unexpectedly strong stroke to get a space compared to the other keys.  But, yes, I have gotten used to it.  The biggest issue is that there is a bit of play in the spacebar, so you have to get accustomed to pushing through that first bit, then really whacking it to get the space you wanted.  (Take ""whack"" with a grain of salt -- it is just a keyboard key, it's not like you need to swing a hammer and hope for the best.)

I actually find the Zoom feature kind of nice.  The other ""extra"" keys haven't gotten much use yet, but as I ramp up the keyboard's use for work -- and Excel -- I think I'll really like the extra numeric keypad keys (parens and equals).

I've been using the Microsoft ergo keyboards for at least a decade.  While not a connoisseur, I am dependent on them for the comfort of my wrists.  I'd say this is at least as comfortable as any of the others, perhaps a mite better.

My biggest frustration, just edging out the spacebar issue, is the fact that the keyboard simply makes a racket.  I was typing on a phone call and I realized that it was literally difficult to hear my colleague over the ""din"" of my keystrokes.  Older versions were definitely quieter.

The wrist pad is perfect and extremely comfortable on the palms. It cleans easily and has yet to show any signs of wear and tear. I type pretty much all day everyday.

Key placement is great, I also like how a couple keys are a little larger so that they are easier to hit when you start going faster, I would have been nice to have uniform keys for switching to the DVORAK board but I just engraved and painted each key with the proper letters and I was good to go.

Miller,"First thing's first, when I was researching this keyboard many users were complaining about the spacebar being too stiff. I've been using it now for two weeks and have determined that the problem is due to the curvature of the keyboard. The farther away from the center of the spacebar you that you tap it, the stiffer it is and is thus less responsive. If you happen to tap it closer to the middle, then it's fine.

I'm a programmer and I type all day long and use the entire keyboard (function keys and all the puntuation that comes with writing code). After I had a chance to use an ergonomic keyboard for a couple months w/o any pain, I finally purchased the Ergo 4000. I love it.

As for a couple specifics, the last ergonomic keyboard I used had an enlarged delete key. The home, end and page keys were normal size. I never got completely used to it and was glad when the Ergo 4000 came with a normal cluster as I use those keys alot.

Also, as is typical, this keyboard has a function lock key that can toggle between the standard function keys and special programmed shortcuts. I use the function keys alot and never use the special functions, so I was also pleasently surprised to discover that function lock is turned on by default. So when I first boot up and login, I don't have to remember to turn the function lock on.

The only con I can come up with is that there is only a single ""Windows"" shortcut key located on the left side. I also use this key a lot and my last keyboard that came with my Gateway had the shortcut key on both sides and I tend to prefer to have the key on the right side. But I can live with it.

I struggled for several days last year with the MS Ergo Keyboard 4000's USB connection -- trying to get it to work through a high-quality Raritan KVM switch (which has PS/2 connectors for mouse and keyboard, no USB), and finally gave up.

I *really* wanted to make it work, since I love many things about that keyboard, but I have to go through KVMs (and I already have a HUGE investment in the Raritan PS/2 equipment, so it would cost a small fortune to replace that with USB KVM equipment).

I thought that it should be possible to make it work -- especially because I have used many other USB keyboards and USB mice with my KVMs.

I tried many things including:

(1) Several different brands of the little USB-to-PS2 and PS2-to-USB convertor/adapters (these are the little green or purple ones, about 1.5"" long that sell for about $3-4 US),

(2) Several of the more ""upscale"" USB-to-PS2 converter/adapters/splitters, such as the kind used for connecting keyboard and mouse to a laptop that has only one connector for external keyboard and mouse (these are about 6""-10"" long, usually having a small nodule-thingie in the middle, with 1 cable about 3"" on one side, and 2 cables about 3"" long on the other side, and sell for about $10.00),

(3) Some high-end USB-to-PS2 converter/adapter/splitter/emulators, like the laptop converter/splitter described above, but additionally having electronics which emulate a mouse (so that, when using a KVM and you switch it from computer A to computer B, Computer A still thinks it has a mouse attached).  (Since the USB connector on these is male, and the USB connector on the MS 4000 keyboard is male, you have to use a F-F gender changer between them). These sell for about $50-150.00.

(4) Praying

(5) Holding my breath and contorting my mouth into unusual shapes,

none of which worked.

I cannot understand WHY it is not possible to get this keyboard to work through USB-to-PS2 converters.  I posted questions in a few online forums about this, but have never gotten any answers.

Since then, I have discovered that there are also a few USB mouses (both wired and wireless) made by Microsoft, which similarly do not work with the KVMs, converters/adapters, splitters/emulators.  (But I have some earlier models of Microsoft USB mice which do work -- such as the  Wireless Optical Mouse 2.0).

I have reluctantly resigned myself to the fact that the MS 4000 Ergo keyboard is not going to be possible for me with my KVM setups.

But -- still I would like to know the reason WHY?!?!  What is Microsoft doing differently with their USB?

It appears to be yet another instance where Microsoft ignores well-established international standards, and designs things they way they think is ""better"", to hell with compatibility with the rest of the world's manufacturer's devices.

But, what is it that Microsoft is doing differently, which they apparently think is better than the USB standard?  What are we gaining from this difference?

Microsoft won't answer this question.  I've sent it to a few of the computer-tech magazines, but they don't seem to be sufficiently interested in the problem to provide an answer.

I would be most grateful if there is someone here who could enlighten us as to the ""WHY"" of this incompatibility.

The keyboard is also pretty large; it's 1"" wider from the right side of the main keyboarding area to the right side of the keyboard, which means my arm has to travel an extra 1"" to find the mouse.  The keyboard is also quite tall with the front riser installed, and frankly, the keyboard angle is horrible without it--so you might want to lower your keyboard surface or raise your chair to compensate for this.

But I stuck with it for a few weeks and overall I'm glad I did.  I still plan to buy a better keyboard, but my hands are much more relaxed than they were with the old conventional keyboard I was using.

I tried to use my old Microsoft Multimedia keyboard but couldn't find an adapter that would make it work on a USB port (I tried 2 different ones), so I thought I would try to make the leap to a more ""ergonomic"" keyboard layout. I bought this one based on other people's reviews. I have been typing on the straight-line layout for 23 years, so I expected to have to adjust to the different layout, but when I tried it out by typing a 3-page letter in Word, I began having the classic carpal tunnel pain for the first time. By the time I was through with the letter, I had pain shooting up to my shoulder and my wrists hurt as well. I seem to have injured myself using this ""ergonomic"" keyboard while I have never injured myself with the ""straight-line"" layout.

I ended up selling this model, took a small loss on it, and then ordered the Microsoft Digital Media Pro keyboard, which I am happy with and seems to be better for me than this one.

The wrist rest on this keyboard is nice. As others have noted, the space bar is hard to tap and takes more force than it should. Much of the functionality of this model is also present on the Digital Media Pro model (hot keys, zoom, ""favorites"" buttons, etc.) and I am much happier with the touch and feel of the Digital Media Pro model than I was with this one. For me, it was a disaster! Obviously other people use it and like it, so each person will have to decide for themselves. It came as a big surprise that ""ergonomic"" was not helpful for me.

I also had trouble with the curved surface because my fingers didn't go to the right places. If I had not experienced so much pain so quickly, I might have tried retraining myself to the new layout, but since I found something else that works better for me, it didn't seem like the way to go.",Not for me!,1184284800,

Some of the Comfort Curve keyboards are just too thin; their key travel is so short it's like your fingers are walking on concrete. But the key travel on this one is very very nice. Also, many of the other Microsoft keyboards have an usuable layout of the Insert, Delete, Home, End, Page Up, Page Down keys. This one has the classic, correct, layout. The wrist rest is also surprisingly comfotable. Microsoft really did a great job on this one!

Some minor negatives: 1) It's usb only, and won't work with a USB-to-PS2 adaptor.

2) The program that allows you to program the extra multimedia keys isn't particularly flexible.

For anyone who spends a lot of time on their computer, ergonomics is a very important consideration when making hardware purchases.  Split key design seems to be the first thing an ergo keyboard should have, but the rest of the design is probably just preferece.  My Kinesis has concaved keys, which is hard to describe, but just imagine putting the keys inside two cereal bowls set apart by a few inches.  This promotes better alignment of your wrists so that they don't need to bend upwards.  The split prevents your wrists from bending sideways.  The MS Natural Ergo KB 4000 finally adds the feature of keeping your wrists from bending up by providing a removeable reverse slope attachment.  Some people may not like this but for me, it's a must.  Also keep in mind that with the reverse slope attachment, your keyboard may not fit under your desk if you're using a keyboard tray.  Mine doesn't.

The keys feel so great when you type and make very little noise.  The wrist rest material feels very smooth and cushy, unlike a lot of cheap plastic wrist rest attachments that some keyboards come with.  I like having a lot of extra buttons on the keyboard so that I don't have to use my mouse as much.  The mouse is the worst ergonomic invention ever.  It has ruined many a wrists.  I have 2 MS Digital Media Pro keyboards that I love as well and wish that the Ergo 4000 had two additional keys that my old KB had.  The Log Off and Sleep buttons were great as I could shut down my machine or switch user without having to use the mouse and click on confirm buttons.  I also wish you could reprogram the zoom button to be a scroll button.

All in all, this is a one fantastic keyboard.  My only small complaint is the lack of some buttons that I liked on their old keyboards.  Also, you should feel very comfortable buying hardware from Microsoft.  I've only ever had to call Microsoft hardware support twice in my life and both times they sent me replacements for my defective/broken items (one mouse and one keyboard) without hassle.",One more positive review,1171238400,

So far, I do like it for the comfort.  It does take getting used to, however, but when you adjust, you won't want to go back to a regular keyboard.

The keyboard is sloped on both sides to make it easier to type, compared to just the regular kind that everyone uses.  The extender that comes with it can be detached, but it's only for people who want to type in a downward angle.  I had no use for it, so I took that off.

Customizing the buttons is very simple. The Back/Forward buttons on the bottom can be changed to Previous/Next if you want to use them for your media players, which is what I did.  The 5 buttons at the top can be programed to open applications or your Favorites. Sadly the Zoom scroller only zooms in on the text instead of scrolling up and down on web pages. Very sad waste of what could have been a very useful key.

I guess my only gripe about this keyboard is the the spacebar really needs a good pounding before it starts to loosen up.  Even as I type this now, I'm still missing some space strokes from time to time.  Also, this keyboard doesn't come with a PS2 adapter, nor will it work for one either.  Make sure you have an open USB slot because that's all it has to plug into your computer.  I didn't mind that at all since I have several unused slots.

What would make this keyboard perfect? Back-lit keys and if the zoom thing in the middle was a scroll for web browsing. None of the back-lit keyboards are anywhere near as comfortable and I have yet to see any keyboard with a scroll control in the middle so this is still my all time favorite keyboard.

- Excellent padded support for the heels of the hands

- Zoom and webpage navigation buttons

- Easy-to-see, well-placed lights on the keyboard for caps lock, function lock, scroll lock, and number lock

- Nice selection of pre-programmed shortcut keys (calculator, web, search, mail) that can be re-mapped to other actions if desired

- Very solid construction...good heft to the keys and just the right amount of tactile feedback.  It does not feel ""cheap.""

- Good adherance to my work surface/desktop.  It does not slide around.

- Rugged.  I've used mine for well over a year with absolutely no problems.

- Color: hides dirt and is stylish.

CONS:

- Not available as wireless

- Not enough controls for CD player (only play/pause...would like eject, FFWD, Track, etc.)

I will warn those who have not used an ergonomic keyboard that it takes some getting used to.  But after you have used it for awhile, ""conventional"" keyboards will feel awkward and cramped, and you'll notice the unnatural angle that they force upon your wrists.

I have used several ergo keyboards over the years and can categorically say that this is the best of the bunch.  Microsoft is the leader in the ergo keyboard market, and they've obviously spent money studying the biomechanics of what makes for a good design.  However, while many of their keyboards have the familiar v-shaped split to the character keys, none have the sting-ray like curved profile of this keyboard, and that is what makes all the difference.

As I mentioned above, I thought at one time that I might have carpal tunnel, but it turned out to be an unrelated problem.  However, I am very happy that I switched to this keyboard anyway.  With as much time as I spend at the computer each day, this keyboard may very well have PREVENTED me from getting carpal tunnel.  I use it in conjunction with a Logitech wireless laser mouse (MX-1000) that I love as well and which I have reviewed elsewhere on Amazon.

If Microsoft would address the few CONS that I outlined above, I think they would have the perfect keyboard.

I don't use the custom keys right now, as the Linux workstation I work on doesn't support them. I'll be upgrading to a newer distribution soon, though, and newer kernels do support the extra keys!

One thing to note - for most people this keyboard will take a bit of getting used to. I still occasionally have issues, but rarely. When I *have* had problems, it is usually because I either am sitting at an odd angle to the keyboard, or have reverted to holding my hands in an improper position.

-- black color is nice, doesn't not appear to get as dirty as old Elits

-- very low noise, no clacking sound

-- the raised stand that comes with it (which lifts the front end) is a little too high; it can be removed, but then it's too low, so you have to improvise (buy some small rubber stoppers from Home Depot and stick on the bottom of this).

I am pleast that it is not cluttered with a bunch of custom keys and that in this verion Microsoft backed away from its cooky big-Delete key layout. The f-lock is also OFF by default with this (it might be the software doing that) which is great if you hate the f-lock as much as the rest of the world.

I moved it from computer.  I loved the layout but was never thrilled by the stiffness of the keys.

Microsoft has done it with this keyboard.

Great feel.  The keys have just the right resistance before they get the detent.  In fact, it feels a little like the original IBM PC keyboard (circa 1982) which was outstanding, but a bit clicky.

Generally, the keys are sized properly, However, the [7/&] key and the [`/~] are oversized, but that is to get the nearby keys into the right position for touch typists.

The keys are the correct size; they are not cramped like a laptop nor are they so spread out that you have to type looking at the keyboard.

It has a removable front platform as well as the more traditional pop-up feet in the rear.  This give you the ability adjust the angle to suit your needs.  One downside is that the front platform, being removable, can be easily lost.

This is the one for me.

The layout of keys is very comfortable for me.  The keys are soft and very quiet.  In a typical office environment, coworkers cannot hear your type - something I wish more keyboard manufacturers took into account.  It shouldn't wake up your roommate, either.

They extreme layout of the keys takes a little getting used to.  It took me an afternoon's work to get it.  The keys, especially the spacebar, take a different about of force that I was used to.

There aren't a disfiguring mass of shortcut keys crammed into the top and sides of the keyboard.  There are a few web/program shortcut keys, and a delightfully minimalist set of media center controls.

If you don't have much real estate on your desk, this may not be the keyboard for you.  Especially be wary of roll-out keyboard trays if you keep the raiser attached. It's significantly taller than just about any other non-'Natural' keyboard.

Comfort. The most comfortable keyboard I've used. The curves take a little getting used to, but it's worth it. Even the (suede-covered and padded) palm rest is subtly curved (in 3 dimensions!) to fit your hand exactly right. A removable prop allows for negative tilt, if that suits your fancy (it's a lot more comfortable than it first seems it should be). Overall, there's a reason they call the design ""natural."" Every aspect is perfectly suited to the way my hands naturally go.

Buttons. Standard 101-key layout plus some handy extras. Top row gives you quick access to frequently used programs. There are buttons for your web browser, the search panel (a sidebar in a folder window to search for files and such), and email. Next to that are five ""favorites"" buttons, which you can easily program to open any programs or run any command line you like. The * button below them brings up a window that reminds you of the current settings and lets you change or update them. Next to that are a mute button, volume up and down, play/pause, and calculator. You can also reprogram any of the buttons to serve a different function if it so suits you. Above the number pad is a row with =() and backspace keys, which make for convenient additions. At the bottom, just below the spacebar, are a pair of unobtrusive keys which function as back and forward browser buttons. All in all, these extra buttons are quickly spoiling me. They save a lot of mousing around.

Zoom Slider. Supposedly, it lets you zoom in or out on just about any window. It doesn't work exactly as advertized for me (I'm using XP Pro), but I don't mind. With Firefox, it works as a scroll stick. In IE, it tries to simultaneously scroll and zoom. Text gets bigger or smaller as you move up and down the page. It's kind of funny, but not really useful. Not a big deal, though, as scrolling in IE can be easily accomplished with the mouse or arrow keys. The slider does work perfectly in WordPad, smoothly adjusting the text size up or down with the touch of a finger.

Construction:

The plastic is a good balance between lightweight and durable. It's not featherweight, but it's significantly lighter than a lot of older keyboards. Even so, it still feels reassuringly solid.

One thing I did notice is that my favorite corner of the spacebar (where my right thumb rests) wore smooth within a day. The key is intact, and the other keys are still in pretty much perfect condition, but the thin traction coating rubbed off in that spot.

Typing Volume:

It's not whisper-quiet, but it's not embarassingly or disruptively loud, either. Slightly softer than average, I'd say. A bit louder than my laptop's built-in keyboard (which has the advantage of flatter keys and a solid surface beneath it, both of which reduce echoes).

Layout:

One commenter mentioned the oversized TGBYHN keys. That's actually fairly standard with split keyboards. It's just that most of them make those keys into plateaus, with the extra space at base level. I actually like this way better. It's got a cleaner look, and the keys work just fine no matter where I hit them.

Simmons,"I am a relative newcomer to the world of comfort and spilt keyboards. I use a computer for a fair amount of the day; at work, and especially at home. I do a lot of communication online, and I have found that when I use a traditional straight keyboard for a long time, my fingers turn to mush. I can't push the keys right, and my wrists hurt terribly.

I decided to invest in a quality keyboard that was designed for comfort and long term use. I looked around, and I found this one. I bought it, and so far, I am very happy with my purchase. There are really alot of selling points that this keyboard has. You can tell that Microsoft had really thought about putting comfort first. For example, this keyboard comes with a built-in (and I mean really BUILT-IN) pad for your wrists. The material that this is made of is really excellent; it provides an excellent amount of comfort without feeling too soft.

The keys on this are the best quiet type that I know of. You can barely hear any clicking at all. They also provide good tactile feedback--neither to hard or too soft. My only complaint here is that the spacebar is too hard out of the box. You really have to push it down in order for it to register. I hope that it becomes easier with continued use, but for right now, it is a little too stiff.

The keys are designed to slope with the natural position of your fingers on the keyboard. This makes it more comforatble to work with, because you don't necessarily have to readjust your fingers to get the right key response. The reach to some of the keys are a little strange until you get used it them. For example, the enter key is shorter than it used to be. So if your natural reach would get you to the inside edge of the enter key before, you will have a bit of a stretch in order to get to it. The backspace, shift, ctrl, caps lock, and tab all also have more reach required to get to them. With a little practice, however, it becomes much easier to hit them.

The enhanced keys on this keyboard are really easy to use. They provide extra functionality and are simple to program. You get five favorite keys, which you can set to open folders, files, web pages, or whatever you want. You also get keys to increase or decrease the volume, open your home page, search, email, and even a key for the caclulator. In this keyboard, the enhanced F keys are great, and you don't have to reset the F-lock after each reboot. Over the number pad, there are some commonly used keys like equals, back and forward parentheses, and backspace. To some, this will make using the calculator easier. I don't mind them, but I wished that they could have put more functionable keys instead of those because they seem a bit redundant to me.

There are also back and forward keys for use with the internet. I love these, because now I don't have to use the mouse to go backward or forward when I am surfing the net. I wish the zoom slider had been a scroll button, though. I don't really ever use the zoom function.

One plus of this keyboard is that the basic special function keys are labeled for you. So you can see that the ctrl key has the asterisk, and that means that when you press ctrl and any key that has the asterisk on it, the function that is labeled by the key will occur.

The unique ergonomics of this keyboard make it far superior than any natural keyboard that I have used. The reverse slope is genius. Turns out that the older design of keyboards was a carryover from the typewriters that needed a ton of finger pressure to use. Microsoft did a ton of research to find a new orientation for the keys, and it worked wonderfully. The slope allows me to type better and easier, while giving me full support for my wrists.

This is really a revolutionary keyboard. I don't have the space to describe how great it is. You just have to try it and see for yourself how unique it is.

This 4000 model, the keys are soft yet you have to hit the keys a little bit harder for it to go down.  The wireless optical pro kit that has a ergo keybord like this is much softer meaning all you have to do is slightly tap the keys and you're good to go.

I think I may be one of thee most pickiest people when it comes to keyboards.  I just cannot stand typing on keyboards that have keys that are hard to press.  I do not understand how everyone goes about their day to day activities and this not even bothers them one bit.  Anyhow, I give it two stars.  The design is nice but the keys are hard to press which mean you have to hit the keys that much more harder.

W.,"I've been using Microsoft Natural Multimedia Keyboard for a while, and it's excellent. I bought this new one because the one I used to have doesn't have USB interface. Compared with the old one, this one has three differences:

1. Arrangements of insert, delete, home, end, page up and down keys. Microsoft decided to change them back to the layout of ""normal"" keyboards. This might be good for some people, but not for someone who's used to the new layout (you can call that layout weird, but I found it pretty good once I got used to it).

2. This keyboard is raised. I thought it would be too high for me and would seem unnatural, but it turns out to be pretty comfortable.

3. The keyboard is split in the middle, with an angle. However, as they move towards the edge (The ctrl, shift, enter, etc keys), they become parallel again. This was not true for the old natural multimedia keyboard. I actually found this to be not as good as the old one. This is because I can have a natural wrist angle when I'm typing on most of the keys, but whenever I want to press the ctrl keys, I have to bend my wrist outwards to press them, which is extra movement I do not want, and would make my hands tired pretty soon. If I do not use the raiser, my wrist would have to bend a lot to press those keys. This really hurts. (that's why I need the raiser, which alleviates the problem, but still doesn't solve it) I don't know why MS decided to do this, but I actually find the layout of their old product better.

The multimedia keys are pretty handy though.

Anyway, this is still much more comfy than those normal keyboards out there.","Good, but with flaws",1141776000,

If you've never used this type of keyboard before, it will take a little time, like a week or two to get used to the placement of keyes, but I'm sure you will be enjoying it more and more every day. Soft tactile response is exceptionally pleasant. The zoom slider would be excellent, if it always worked as intended (see below).

Cons: I bought this keyboard to be sure it's compatible with my new 64-bit system. My reasoning was, if the 64-bit Windows are created by Microsoft and this keyboard is designed by Microsoft, the two must fit each other perfectly. Well, this is not exactly the case.

Apparently Microsoft was too busy to design a native 64-bit driver for their keyboards. The driver that comes with this keyboard works with both the 32 and 64-bit Windows, but functionality in the 64- bit OS is limited. You can type fine and most function keys work as intended, but you can not use the volume up/down function even with the Microsoft Media Player in the 64-bit Windows, as it won't work. Also the zoom slider works fine in the MS Word and most IE browsing situations, but does not work with the 64-bit Mozilla (Deer Park version) and even in IE sometimes starts acting strange (such as suddenly becoming a scroll wheel, instead of a zoom). I guess, Microsoft shouldn't complain that many software and hardware companies ignore the 64-bit version of Windows, as they themselves keep ""forgetting"" about it.

Another small drawback is that the ""Enter"" key is a bit too small for comfort. But I got used to it and it doesn't bother me anymore.

My conclusion: This is a fantastic keyboard for anyone who types a lot. It literally makes typing a joy. Let's hope its functionality in Windows XP Pro x64 OS will be upgraded with a new native 64-bit driver in the near future.","Great typing keyboard, but...",1137888000,

The first is the terrific riser in the front, creating a negative tilt. To create this tilt on the Pro, I had to elevate my wrists by using a piece of 2 by 4 cut to match the keyboard and then equipped with a wrist rest. The new Ergo has both the height and the rest set up perfectly. Note that if you have your keyboard set on a table or tray that is too high, this would be awkward. When the keyboard is set up properly (forearms  parallel to the floor  see site [...] ), the Ergo is extremely kind to your wrists and the best I have EVER used. The lift can be removed but please try to use it, the negative tilt is a terrific ergo device.

The second improvement is that the keys are much better. They take to edge hits much better than the old keyboard. There are also a lot less noisy than the Pro. (There is indeed a dead spot on the extreme  upper corners of the space bar but I have NEVER noticed it- I have to contort my thumbs just to hit the spacebar like that and is a very unnatural).

The third improvement is the wealth of special keys, especially the favorites key and the F lock and num lock keys that remembers their settings. The favorites can start a program that you choose while the other silver keys can do commands (like copy, paste, and exit). The back/forward buttons I find pretty much useless as I have these set up on my mouse. The zoom key is used to change text size which works well for my old trifocal eyes.

Negatives? Pretty large keyboard,  black, and the wrist rest is padded but not a cushy as my old gel one.

However, after a few days of using this newly redesigned keyboard, I was extremely disappointed and had to exchange it for a standard logitech keyboard.

First, this keyboard is very large. This really isn't a problem. However, the tiny plastic feet that support the back of the keyboard can barely support it's weight. Any pressure on these feet will cause them to bend or break. Once looking at them, you'll easily see why.

Second, it looks like Microsoft decided that since the keyboard was split and that they had extra room, they would change the size of a few lettered keys towards the middle so they are twice the size of a normal key! Add this to the fact that the keys feel ""squishy"" and you've got one crazy typing experience. It certainly does not feel natural at all. I really did try to get use to this, but I kept finding myself pressing incorrect keys, or having to look at the keyboard to make sure I hit the right key.

The large hot keys at the top of the keyboard are a nice touch. But for media playback, it has a Play/Pause button, and that's it. No next, forward, back, or even a stop button. For no apparent reason, they are simply nowhere to be found.

Now, it does feel comfortable (even though you can barely type at half your normal typing speed), and it looks great. And that's where the compliments end. I even had 2 other friends try out the keyboard, and they agreed... it's just not natural.

Pros:

- It looks great in black/silver

- Comfortable to rest your hands on the keyboard

- Keyboard has a good solid feel (excluding feet).

Cons:

- The tiny plastic feet are useless

- Some letters on keyboard are larger than others (annoying)

- Keys feel way too soft and offer no feedback

- Missing extra media controls

While this keyboard may be ""comfortable"" and looks nice, it's just not practical for daily use if the feet break, the keys feel strange, and it slows down your typing experience.

Do yourself a favor and avoid cordless technology (bluetooth especially) when it comes to keyboards.  A cordless mouse is a solid choice--but a cordless keyboard--what's the big gain there anyway?  They shut down all the time to save power, there's often a lag--and that's just the tip of the iceberg.  After a little reading on the subject you'll understand why corded, for now, is the way to go for keyboards.

In my experience, Logitech makes the best mice and Microsoft makes the best keyboards.  Logitech's designs are getting stranger and stranger while Microsoft is focusing on what's worked on previous designs (related to *keyboards*) and have made some smart improvements.

It's got several nice changes over many other keyboards in the Natural range:

- Regular layout for the Home, End, Delete, etc. keys block. (This can be both a blessing and a curse, depending on how long you've been using the Microsoft proprietary layout.)

- Very nice key feedback: soft and quiet, but a very clear response.

- ""Tilt-down"" just like the very early models (and some competitor models) used to have. This is definitely the most ergonomic keyboard in a while. Note that you can easily remove the tilt down piece, if you choose to.

Getting used to the slightly different key layout (the keys arch up on each side of the split) took a few hours, but is working great for me now.

This keyboard is large though. It is practically too big for my keyboard drawer: the keyboard does not fully emerge from under the desk and I cannot close my keyboard drawer anymore.

The additional keys above the numeric keypad are remarkably handy. Microsoft added the =, (, ) and backspace keys. When using the calculator (or Excel), these keys really do speed up the data entry process.

However, the very best feature is just a small change I've been hoping for ever since Microsoft re-assigned the function keys to have a dual action, depending on the F-Lock status.

I used it to replace a Microsoft Natural Elite keyboard. The wrist/palm rests feel very nice, and I like the fact that the keys are quiet - I'm trying to train myself to take notes while on the phone using the computer instead of using a pad of paper, and I find that loud typing while I'm talking on the phone can interfere with my hearing the other person, and with their perception of my attention. The software does seem relatively Spartan but to be honest I'm not a big user of customization features, so it doesn't impact my use of the device. In the past, I haven't even bothered to install keyboard driver software. The zoom feature works nicely in Firefox, I don't use IE much.

So, for my use - standard typing for many hours/day, minimal use of special features - it's a great keyboard. I'm glad it's got the older-style cursor key/insert-delete-scroll key setup, rather than the setup used on the Natural Elite, that I never did really become accustomed to.

Chances are pretty good I'll buy another one to use at home this weekend - I am really happy with this, enough so that I'm ready to give up the old ergo keyboard I've got at home that doesn't have the negative tilt but does have the arrow-key configuration that I prefer.

It might be a mistake (I think not), but Firefox supports the zoom feature much better than IE but its not listed. Maybe their scared to lose IE clients b/c of people who purchase their keyboard.

Getting it set up was pretty dumb. I installed the software, shutdown, swapped keyboards, booted and I couldn't log in. I had to shut down the computer again and boot with both keyboards so Windows would recognize the Microsoft keyboard after it booted up. I wonder what those 4 loading screens do if not load drivers that I just installed. Anyways, I checked Microsoft update to see if there was a critical update or security patch for the keyboard and luckily there wasn't. I actually hoped there would be something to allow us to map zoom to scroll.

If you ever go to a typing class, read a book on typing, or do a computer typing program, the 6 key should be pressed by the right hand.  Microsoft never seems to learn that and puts it on the left side of this keyboard.

The overall keyboard feels smooth and the keys are easier to use than a square keyboard. However, everytime that I need to press the 6 key, I have to relearn where it ""is"" as oppose to where it ""should"" be.

It stays on my desk as if it were a desktop computer. So the other day I was tired of being cooped up as usual indoors doing my homework. I went outside and it was lovely. I checked my address on accuweather's minutecast and it said no chance of rain at my house for at least 120 minutes (it only shows you 120 minutes at a time). So I wash my outside table down and go and get my laptop and bring it outside. I set it up and log into my course to get started. Decide I am going to go grab a drink and bring it outside. I go in and get my drink and think ""is that rain I hear?"" sure in hell it was! I run out and bring my laptop in and dry it off. I told myself it was okay (trying this positive thinking out) but decided to place it upside down on my bed to help any moisture out of it. Did this the rest of the night and even over night on a pillow. Next day I decide maybe I should go buy some rice. Bought a ridiculous amount of rice and put my laptop (with all crevices taped up) and kept in bin with rice for about 2 days. Took it out and it booted right up. Awesome right? Wrong, some of my keys decided they were no longer going to work. Of course keys that I need to log in with my password. So I come running to Amazon to save the day figuring there has to be some sort of external laptop keyboard and what do you know? There is. I purposely ordered some other items so I could get same day shipping. Took it out of the box and plugged it in and behold! I have a working laptop once again!
It works great, keys are super loud but seriously if your laptop keyboard stops working you can still use your laptop by buying this. And it was only 10 bucks! I couldn't be more happy. Everything was on this laptop, my homework, my son's baby photos, you name it. Some things I have never gotten around to putting on a portable hard drive, so a lot could have been lost if I couldn't have found a way to use it again.",The Best $10 I Have Ever Spent!

Have you any idea how hard it is to find a classic, standard keyboard? Even when you think you've found one, it'll have some deviation from the classic, like a short backspace, or no Windows key, or whatever. It seems that for every one of those precious standard keyboards there are a hundred weird and wonderful versions, with lights all over the place, Internet shortcuts, tracking pads, all sorts of knobs and buttons for playing games and whatnot... For heaven's sake, guys, I just want to input to my computer. Give me a classic keyboard without bells and whistles...please!!

Well, my prayer was answered when I found this HP keyboard. No bells and whistles. No funny buttons, wheels, lights, tracking pads or shortcut keys. Just the standard QWERTY with a number pad, all the right unprintable keys, like Insert, Delete, Tab, Backspace and so on, no weirdness, and at a great price.

The keyboard worked in Windows 10 as soon as I plugged it into my laptop. Didn't need any drivers, downloads, or anything like that. Just plug-n-play. And I love the feel of the keys, kind of soft but firm, with no annoying clicking.

And I've kept up with the maintenance and all the updates and even jumped up to Windows 10. Which was working OK. I mean it was still pretty buggy but I was getting used to it and our PC had a combination Bluetooth keyboard and mouse that plug into the one USB port. And sure enough one of the updates for windows 10 screwed up my Bluetooth survice so bad that I couldn't even use my mouse and keyboard anymore so at first I just ordered the keyboard thinking that would make it able for me to fix it. But no no no. This update trashed my PC so bad my only option was to do a full factory reset and bring my PC back to just out of box condition. And when I tried to upgrade back to Windows 10 it was trying to charge me 300 dollars. And that wasn't happening but my PC wouldn't run right anymore because windows 7 stopped getting updates and it kept crashing. So finally I call Microsoft and bitch at the guy whom I could hardly understand. I even told him to take over my PC remotely and talk to me trough text. But since I had gotten the free upgrade last time it was still somewhere in my Microsoft account and he was able to see upgrade me to  10. But boy that was a hassle I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy. But this keyboard was perfect for what I needed it to be. Cheap and working with a USB cord.

Will try a  Fellows next as I have had good luck with those over the years.

This is the third keyboard for my HP computer.  Bought this one because the C, V and M had worn off on the old keyboard.  Hopefully the new letters will last longer.  After getting this keyboard my HP computer died and I bought a new Envy high end HP computer.  It came with wireless keyboard and mouse.  Discovered very quickly that they new keyboard is smaller and that the Zero on the key pad was no longer two spaces wide so kept hitting the arrow key.  Very strange for a business oriented computer where most of us use our thumb to hit the zero key.  Result, trashed the new keyboard and mouse and went back to wired model.

In short, you couldn't just pop off the keys and switch them around then change the software layout. This keyboard has keys that let you swap them all around with each other so you can accomplish that.

But, if you're planning to do a ton of typing every day, and you're very sensitive to how a keyboard feels as you type hour after hour, this may be important to you.

The main reason that people would want keyboards with large characters, is so that they will be easy to read without glasses.
On this criterion this keyboard fails. the characters  :<>?{}|  are the roughly the same size as a regular keyboard and the "" character is even shorter than a regular keyboard.

2.) The contrast between the charters (Red, Purple or Blue) and the black keys is poor - further decreasing the legibility of all but the largest fonts. A good color here would be bright white.

3.) All keys that have 2 characters -  like the key for ' and "" or the key for / and ?  - have the order reversed. The character that should be on top is on the bottom, and vice versa.  For example on the key for  / and ?  the / is on top and the ? is on the bottom, where it should be the other way around.",Some small characters. Low contrast between characters and keys.

3019,B00I0S6SK0,Azio Vision Backlit USB Keyboard with Large Print keys and 5 Interchangeable Backlight Colors (KB506) - Wired,4.0,,True,"05 11, 2018",AI32AO3TTCTY7,{'Style Name:': ' 5 Color'},Art the Science Guy,"My favorite, most used keyboard in my office is my Das 4 Professional Soft Tactile MX Brown Mechanical Keyboard. I mention this so that you could have an idea as to what I look for in a keyboard. Although Das does make an illuminated keyboard, Das Keyboard Prime 13 White LED Backlit, at $129.00 its a bit too steep for most of us. I wanted an illuminated keyboard for home use so I could use it at night without disturbing anyone by having to keep the overhead lights on.

I ended up buying 4 keyboards looking for the one that not only had good backlighting but also good typing action making it easy to see at night and easy to type on. I wanted to keep the price to around $50.00  so here is what I bought: At the end of the review I compare all four keyboards.

Azio  Vision Large Font Keyboard ($29.99)

This keyboard has large font: letters, numbers and symbols making it very easy to read in a darkened room. The lighting is even throughout the entire keyboard, there are no bright or dark areas and you can easily change the color of the keys for the entire keyboard or within the 5 lighting zones. For people with vision impairments, this is your keyboard. It is easy to use, set-up and change colors. The typing action on it is very unsatisfying for me as the keys are larger than standard keys so my fingers are not used to the spacing. Also, the height of the keys is somewhat shallower than standard keys and the resistance when you type is mushy at least for me. That said, for visually impaired people who are used to the common $15 to $20 keyboard this will be fine for you and at $30, it is a bargain.

Perixx PX-1100 ($59.99)

The keyboard has serious flaws that significantly interfere with it's stated purpose. It is supposed to be illuminated so that it could be used in a dark room. It specifically states that it has key and letter illumination which it does but here lies the problem - the illumination is very uneven with some keys being very bright and others just an inch or two away being very dim. As an example, the left arrow key on my keyboard was very bright while the right arrow key was barely visible especially since the keys next to it were so bright! Another factor is the brightness surrounding the keys which in some areas is brighter than the keys themselves which makes it more difficult to read them. This keyboard apparently has ""zone illumination"" meaning that it has just a few LED's lighting up the keys and in some places, near the edge of the zones, there are dim areas - very dim areas, even with the brightness at maximum. If you're buying this for the illumination to make it easier to read in a dark room, look elsewhere. If you want a cool looking, colorful keyboard that has relatively good good typing action this is your keyboard, it is heavy, well built, has good typing action and poor lighting. This was the first one I bought and I was very disappointed with it, hence the mediocre rating.

Logitech K740  Fullsize Illuminated Slim Keyboard ($59.99)

This keyboard is very slim in fact, the travel of the keys when you type is minimal and they are very shallow which I am not used to, so I found typing on it unsatisfying. The keyboard reminds me of the one on my inexpensive, compact laptop which gets the job done when Im traveling but is not designed for serious typing. The illumination however is excellent, bright white and very legible. Set-up is simple and adjusting the brightness is straight forward. If my go-to keyboard wasn't so good, I probably wouldnt have an issue with this one. Once you have typed on a quality keyboard with mechanical switches you get spoiled! At $60 on sale, I was underwhelmed.

Corsair K55 Gaming Keyboard ($47.99)
This keyboard basically met my expectations for typing feedback and illumination for the price but its far from perfect. When you first connect it to your computer you will be met with an over the top moving display of colors flowing across the entire keyboard which is very distracting and thankfully easily changed with just a few key strokes. You can make it all one color if you wish and choose the color you want or make each zone a different color. The keyboard is light weight like most cheap keyboards, lighter even than the non-illuminated Dell keyboard that it replaced but it gets the job done. The first thing I noticed is that the illumination is crisp and even throughout the keyboard. The letters and symbols are centered on the keys and a bit bolder in font than average keyboards. The keys are not individually illuminated but there are enough LEDs to give it an even appearance. The lighting around the keys is somewhat bright but not to the point of making them difficult to read as on the Perixx. Although the keys themselves are not mechanical, they feel somewhat mechanical giving it a nice tactile experience. The keys have the same height as one would find on a good standard keyboard and have about the same travel as well, so it is a good keyboard to type on or use for gaming or both!

There are many illuminated keyboards out there and I spent hours shopping on Amazon and reading reviews trying to finds one that would be right for me. For some people, the typing action may be secondary and so for them, the best buy would be the Azio Vision Large Font Keyboard which at $29.99 is a bargain. It is the easiest by far to read under any conditions and very easy to use/set-up. The Logitech at $60 is also very easy to read but it is twice the price of the Azio. That said, the keys are standard size and it is very well made. For me, the Corsair K55 was the best compromise; although the Azio and the Logitech are easier to read, the Corsair is also easy to read, they are just a bit better in visibility but when I considered typing feel and speed , the Corsair wins.

I hope this helps some of you make the right buying decision.

I read the negative reviews (the only ones that you can trust), but I bought it anyhow because the allure of lighted key caps was so inviting, and my vision is not so good. And it looked great for about 2-3 days. Then I started to get double or triple key-press entries for some keys pressed. Widespread, but not even 50% of the keys.. enough however to render the keyboard unusable. And having cut my electronics teeth at KeyTronics (a high-end keyboard manufacturer).. I know that it is not so hard to make a good keyboard. This is a noisy keyboard, has kind of a long travel for the keys and there is virtually no tactile feedback (except when you bottom out). The feedback is mostly auditory. The LED color selections, and dimming capability are nice, but first and foremost, the keyboard must function as a keyboard. I've come to an obvious conclusion - I would say ""Do Not Buy"". I'll never buy any revision of this, nor any product, from this company again. You only get 1 chance to trick me. This one was your chance. To lure me back is going to require extraordinary improvement. If they read these reviews (the manufacturer), which they should, because Amazon is probably their biggest customer, then they would know how to improve it.
1. Make it work reliably
2. Dedicated Hibernate key (screen blank)
3. Clear key for the calculator
4. Add tactile feedback (this will be tough, requires higher quality switches)
But the concept is fantastic. Why can't they just make this thing work?

This keyboard has a good weight to it, not cheap plastic light and not too heavy. Appears to be well made. It has a solid feel to it all the way around. One can feel the construction just by holding it. The back-lighting is very good and evenly lit across the whole board, no dim or dark spots as I have experienced with other back lit boards.
It also has a choice of lighting colors. It is very easy to change those colors, all one does is hit a dedicated button that is clearly marked. One of the nice features bedside being very easy to read, is the LED brightness wheel. You can adjust the brightness of the back-light from completely off to it's brightest setting. This is a feature that all back lit keyboards should have, but few do. I have had many such keyboards and had to cover them at night otherwise they put too much light in the room to sleep.
The only ""con"" if you can call it that, is the keys themselves. This keyboard is the flat key design, not island keys, so it takes some getting used to in order to type on it. I am still challenged by this being used to standard island style boards.

Red is especially good for not disturbing night-vision.

HOWEVER, having said that there are TWO detracting factors that prevent me from offering a five star review:

1. On all keys showing both normal and ""Shifted"" functions, the graphics are inverted!  The UC (Shifted) function in on the BOTTOM and the normal function is on the TOP!!??  I cannot fathom WHY they would do that, but it's confusing to those of us who are not typists.  It slows progress while your brain has to figure out which is correct.

2. The keys are unstable giving the keyboard an awkward feel.  The keys rock slightly sided-to-side when pressed. They do not just move up & down like a normal keyboard.  This is unsettling to a normal ""Typist"" who types by feel!

If you need to work in the dark; BUY this keyboard.  You'll like it!

However, if you're not a mole, you will NOT be happy with this keyboard beyond the novelty!  In that case I would NOT recommend this product.

Rzepela,"Bought one of these (KB505U) in 2012 and with daily use, it only started showing problems about a week ago. (The A-S-D row started failing). The replacement version that I got (purchased from Azio, and arrived today) is the same size as the 2012 vintage (it fits in a custom drawer), but the lettering style on the keys does not match the images of the keyboard currently on Amazon's item page. The new lettering is thicker and more squat looking. (Jury's out on legibility, because I spent 5 years with the old one and 5 minutes with the new one.) And for the six-key keypad (INS, DEL, etc.) Azio has decided to put the full words on the keys instead of the abbreviations (Insert instead of INS, Delete instead of DEL), so of course... the letters all have to be a lot smaller. (A LOT).

I suppose the change in lettering style is a matter of taste, but a keyboard sold as ""Large Print"" really should have not reverted from SL to trying to fit SCROLL LOCK on a tiny key. Another distraction: light from the LED inside peeks out from underneath the row of Function keys (F1-F12). The construction of the ""classic"" KB505U (as shown in the zoomable images on Amazon's site) has the keys sunken enough that you never see that escaping light. Now, every Fn key looks underlined. I guess this means that you had to be more precise in using those keys on the old one, but I never had a problem, but then again, I don't use the Fn keys that much. Maybe Azio was just reacting to customer feedback.

Anyway, I loved my Azio KB505U ""classic"", and its new replacement is working well enough. But I dinged one star for Amazon's pix not accurately showing the redesign, and Azio's decision to go backwards on the accessibility front by putting tiny little letters on the keypad. Had I seen these changes, I might have gone with a different replacement.","Happy with my 5-year-old Azio KB505U, but new revs to design are a step back from ""5-star"".",1510617600,

I bought 3 keyboards each with VISIBILITY features, ultimately keeping 2 of 3.

1)  Logitech K800 Wireless Illuminated keyboard is now my day-to-day replacement of my Sculpt.  I was looking for improved visibility in low light and the Logitech offers an interesting option which works.  It has lots of reviews as a best seller, mostly positive.  I love the quality feel of this keyboard and the mechanics of the key strokes are GREAT, very nice feel not at all mushy.  I was wary of the cluster of reviews suggesting quality had declined and reliability was now an issue - so I am wary and hoping Logitech fixed the difficulties so many referenced.  This is not an inexpensive keyboard and customers deserve a reliable product.  After 3 months I am okay but cautious.

2)  Nuklz Large Print Wired White Keys is my second keeper of the 3.  It is 1/3rd the price of my Logitech but the visibility of the large WHITE keys is fabulous.  It is wired versus the Logitech wireless and I like the absence of clutter with wireless.  But the super visibility and very nice key stroke responsiveness convinced me to keep this as my backup keyboard.  This exceeds my expectations for visibility at a very cheap price and is better than other lighted keyboards I researched/purchased.

3)  AzioVision Backlit Wired keyboard looked promising with many good reviews and I purchased for the visibility feature.  I sent it back as the key strokes were too mushy for my preference and the varied light options just didn't add that much to seeing your keys in dim light.  Lots of people like this, so this is just my experience.

Since keyboards have limited life, especially wireless models, I hope my experience and conclusions are helpful to some.  I opted to keep two new keyboards - one wireless and one wired - the thinking being that the wired board would be more reliable and have greater life expectancy than the Logitech K800.

FYI - I tried a couple of new computer mouse options as well.  I found the simple, inexpensive Amazon Basics to be a great size, price and performance such that I ultimately bought a second as back-up.",Bought 3 new keyboards - kept 2,1509408000,

I did spill a small amount of water on it this morning, but seriously just a tablespoon, tops. So when it went crazy, typing nothing but slashes, I figured it was that. I came in to see if it was under warranty (no), so I am torn between buying a new one or getting a different brand.  Reading the reviews though, I see something that I thought was me - that the board will type something like ""a8t ""instead of ""at"". With tonight's crazy attack, when I could get it to stop typing slashed, it would type double numbers (like 23 when I hit the 2 key). So I am thinking that maybe it was not the spill but just coincidence?

Anyway, taking another chance on this because otherwise it's amazing, and I would rather use it than my Logitech $200 gaming keyboard. Will update after testing new one. Wish me luck!",Fantastic style - Substance...eh,1508630400,

Unfortunately I must report that although it dims fine, it doesn't actually dim any but the primary colors. Meaning if you have selected a compound color and start to dim it, it reverts to one of the primary colors used to make that compound color when it reaches anything less than ~75% brightness.  So no dimming pink, purple, yellow, or cyan (my personal choice if I could dim it). You can dim red, blue and green.  That's it.

On top of that, the wrist rest is a strange texture that seems like it would offer traction, but your wrists will slide down it anyway.  So it's uncomfortable and doesn't perform it's intended purpose.

And lastly the layout chosen for certain keys is awkward.  The < > and ? are under the comma, period and / and a much smaller font giving the impression that they are the primary characters of said keys, and the other characters are obtained by using the Shift key.  This only confuses me when I am looking at the keyboard, which isn't often, but it's still annoying when it happens.

Over all for $30, it's barely passable as a decent keyboard unless you need the larger, more easily seen characters.  Then I suppose it would be a decent keyboard, if it weren't for the characters being difficult to see in normal light and the lighting off even with perfect eyesight.  So it's not even 5 stars in that event.","Awkward Wrist Rest, and some Colors Don't Dim",1506384000,

Although the blocky symbols on the keys are not always easy to read, they are large and well-lit.  Also, the ability to adjust the brightness and change the color is very cool.

The keyboard otherwise is not easy to use:

1.  It's hard to know exactly where your fingers/hands are on the keys.  The top of the keyboard is very flat.  The tops of the keys themselves are flat, not slightly concave like on most other keyboards.  It's not easy to feel where one key stops and the next one starts.  I'm continually looking down to see which keys my hands are on.

2.  The symbols are very large  which is good  but they've decided to not put all of the symbols on the keys.  For instance, on the number pad, they have numbers only.  There are no symbols for arrows, Page Up, Page Down, Home, or End.  I've had to stop and look at other keyboards to see what the keys for those functions are.  Perhaps the font is too large and blocky to get everything on the face of the key.

3.  Some of the writing on the keys is confusing.  The semi-colon, which you press Shift to get, is twice as large as the colon, and also, the apostrophe, which you also press Shift to get, is twice as large as the quotation mark.  On some keys, what you get with the Shift key is in the lower right, and on other keys, it's in the upper left.  Can I figure all of this out?  Yes.  But I don't like stopping for a minute to think about what the keys are for.

4. The bottom of the keyboard is an uncomfortable feel for me.  It's 2 1/8 inches from the bottom of the spacebar to the bottom of the keyboard.  So I have to anchor the bottom of my hands to the keyboard rather than the desk.  Maybe it's just me, but I prefer to anchor the bottom of my hands to the desk.

Over the year or two that I've had this keyboard, I've tried three times getting used to it.  Each time, I've given up and gone back to an older keyboard.  I don't mis-hit keys on other keyboards like I do on this one.

Update:  The lighting is not perfect.  The pilot lights for things like Num Lock and Caps Lock are deeply recessed and not visible during normal use of the keyboard.  You have to lean over and look directly down into the recessed area to see if a pilot light is on.",Back-lighting very good; everything else not so much,1502928000,

But, this keyboard is NOT perfect.  It has three glaring problems. First,  for some reason the designers put the Shift characters in the lower right-hand corner of the Keys instead of above,  Normally, Shift characters are above the non-shift characters.  This is unlike any other keyboard and seriously hurts it's functionality.  Why did the designers do this?  Only their use of a standard font allows this keyboard to be at least functional.  Next, the keyboard lights don't go off.  The only thing to do once your PC has powered down is to turn down the brightness.

However, the first keyboard did not have a separate numbers keypad, and it became apparent that I missed that, plus the clicky keys were very noisy, so back it went.  The second one was another low cost gamer keyboard with, again, clicky keys (that were not as noisy as the other keyboard), but one of the cursor keys began working intermittently, so back it went.  I then found this one with a very reasonable price, illuminated keys, but with membrane type key mechanisms instead of mechanical.  Turns out these keys were of a better design than your typical membrane keys,and work very well for me.  The markings on the keys are overly large, and with the led lighting, make this keyboard exactly what I was looking for.  The price is quite reasonable, the keyboard works great and seems durable.  It has three colors, one of which is a sort of magenta (or light purple) that I thought might be strange when I read the keyboard's description, but turns out it is my preferred color of the three.

My old keyboard trained me to hit a certain position, while this new keyboard I kept hitting the shift key for a while. Strange how the body works while forming habits. I think also that the words CAPS LOCK, TAB, SHIFT and CNTL are done too large. This was part of the factor I hit the SHIFT key instead of the ENTER key. If they reduced the size of the font on those particular keys it would be the perfect keyboard. Leaving the ENTER key font size the same. Anyway, the keyboard is solid and worth the price.

This keyboard has a lot of great features, and up until now I have enjoyed it's usefulness.

I have had my Logitech G15 Keyboard for 10 years. I had the original and it worked well. Actually it was a battle tank that kicked bum, took names and still can put the hurt on any game that I want. But I work at night and I like to keep the light in my office low. Sadly the lights in that G15 failed and I needed to replace it. It's been a year long search and then I thought why not go for an oddball choice.

It's not a beast or war machine like some but yet it is also not a flimsy bendable thing like one of my attempted purchases.
The keys are not the older style that I'm used to but yet I still can get going up to about 50 WPM before I start to get a little slippy and slidey on the keys.
The function key up top are what you'd expect. A little extra without having to setup your own macros.
The keyprint is actually one of my favorite things. It's easy to read and the light has enough pass through space to get through and be very readable about 2AM when you're trying to work.
The three color choices are good. I actually am partial to the violet more than the red and blue. I do wish you could adjust the brightness levels but that's not a deal breaker. Also, a straightup on off switch would be wonderful. But these are nitpicks.

After a month, it has proven to be a proper choice. I wish there a few hardware things different and that software was available for a little extra customization. Some complained about the keyprint rubbing off but not yet. The only thing rubbing off it the logo on the palm rest.",Backlit and practical on a budget.,1492041600,

The manufacturer read my review and contacted me immediately.  I had replacement keys a couple days later, no hassle, no fuss.  Thanks!!

ORIGINAL REVIEW:
I very much like this keyboard and had I wrote this review several month ago probably would have given it 5 stars.  The last time I purchased a keyboard was 2007 so it lasted 10 years. And even then the keyboard functioned perfectly but the padded palm rest in the front was cracked and destroyed so I searched long and hard for a suitable replacement and chose this one due to the size, backlit keys, and dedicated hit keys on the top.

This keyboard is barely 6 months old and the paint is already chipping/rubbing off the keys. I have to assume it's only going to get worse and eventually the keys will be unreadable.  While I really do like everything else about this keyboard, the paint is a big one for me. Especially with the backlit keys, it makes it even worse. I'm dreading how this will look a couple years from now.",Paint is already failing,1491436800,['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71tc3hS+RgL._SY88.jpg']

The adjustable flip-up feet on the bottom don't really make much difference in the angle of the keyboard, so I had to find some little rubber feet to stick onto the back of the keyboard to reach a comfortable position. It's a little noisy, and the key response isn't well designed for fast typers (I typically do 80-90wpm) but your average hunt-and-peck typer won't notice this. The key tops are mostly flat, without the concave dish shape of my previous keyboard, so again, as a fast typist, I'm finding I have to settle into a new comfort position for this keyboard.

All that said, I love the huge lettering on the keys, and the backlighting is a very nice addition. Two features which really help my aging eyes. I chose the model with variable backlight intensity, and I'm glad I did. With it adjusted to full brightness, it's really, really, distractingly bright! After a few minutes of fussing with the color choices and intensity settings, I settled into a combination that was comfortable to look at and not distracting, but still provides sufficient key lighting to be useful.

Overall, I would recommend this for someone who doesn't do a bunch of typing, or types at slower speeds, or anyone else with aging eyes!",Delivers what I expected for the price point,1489017600,

The only problem I have is that there is no way to turn off the back-light of the keys. The provided button only switches between three colors but it does not include an off option. So at night, the keyboard remains with its back-light on, despite the desktop is off. It is a waste of energy and it will reduce the lifespan of the LEDs.

UPDATE
found it! the same button you have to press to change among the different colors, if you hold it for a couple seconds, it does turn off the LEDs. I wonder why this feature was not included on the guides. So, this is it. A very nice keyboard for who works or plays at night.

I bought this keyboard because I do a lot of work in a low light environment, and seeing the keys on my unlighted keyboard was becoming more and more difficult as my eyes weaken with age.

Unlike some reviewers, I have not experienced any ""sticking"" keys.  All of the keys on my keyboard operate very smoothly.  The ""feel"" of the keys is a little different than my old HP keyboard, but not in a bad way -- just different.

Really bad idea

When you hold the ""shift"" key and tap a letter key you expect to see either a capital letter or if you hit the 8, you expect to get the *, the asterisk

The labels are all opposite and upside down.
Without shift hit the 3 key you get the hashtag  ""#""

I have been using this keyboard now for ~2 months and I still like it a great deal.  Despite the problems others nhave experienced, the keys on mine work well with no sticking.
Complaint__ there are two gripes I have after using this for a while.  I use it for websurfing and playing online PC video games which is the main reason I needed to see the letters well.  I use a Logitech G13 and mouse for main game controls but the keyboard is a necessity for all the extra game functions.
1) Not having my hands on the keyboard all the time because it is in a different position eliminates touch typing and its gets shoved around, I often need to see where I am putting my finger. My keyboard is not the same as the photos included with the body of the sales page.  The LETTERS and NUMBERS are aoll large and wonderful but the pure function keys (, <  . >  / ?  ; :  ` ~  ,etc) are all smaller than then pic indicates and HARDER to read than a regular keyboard.
2) The indicator lights for num lock, caps lock and scroll lock are apparently soldered directly to the component board below a hole through the case.  This works if you are sitting with your eyes at only a slight angle from said hole but at the angle I use the keyboard, I need to lift it to see if those lights are on.  I have jury rigged it by putting a piece of masking tape over the hole so the light diffuses passing through the paper and makes a discernible light spot.  Except, why should I have to jury rig a brand new item to use it comfortably. Do the Chinese even have engineers except for making weapons?
--- I still like the keyboard and it performs well despite some small engineering ... umm ... oversights.
============================================================================
An excellent keyboard with large backlit letters.  I am retired ~10 years and my eyes seem to reaching their use-by date and the large letters are a boon that will keep me using the computer a while longer.  I bought a 60"" TV back a year or more ago to use as a computer monitor and that helps the visual end a lot also although TVs do not handle text as well as good monitors.  The colors are not excessively bright which was a concern I had from seeing other keyboards which lit up like a carnival.  The brightness is somewhat directional-- brightest looking straight down onto the keys and the dimmest at an oblique angle as when the key board is flat on the desk, away from your body a little.  Propping it up with the feet or a wedge stand will help make it brighter if you need to.  ALL the keys work very smoothly but I no longer can touch type and others may have a problem

#2 the windows key is placed in a way that allows it to be pushed by mistake when using the shift key. In a game that will close the game screen taking me to desktop.

One keyboard was for my mom, and the other was for my aunt.  They are both getting older and were having trouble seeing the keyboard at night while they play canasta online and chat with one another.  They arrived in the standard cardboard keyboard box.  At the time both were running Windows 8.  After plugging it in, Windows detected it immediately.  All functions like volume, favorites, ect. worked without setup.  Both have since upgraded to Windows 10 and there have been no issues.  The buttons are large and clearly marked.  I am used to my compact laptop keyboard, so I do occasionally make typing mistakes, but both mom and aunt say that they got used to it very quickly.  The back lighting is the best feature.  With all the lights out, it is easy to see what you are typing.  I bought the 3 color model, and don't think the extra colors are necessary.  Both my mom, and aunt always keep the light blue.  My only complaint is how short the cord is.  Sometimes I like to browse the internet with the keyboard on my lap, and the cord just isn't long enough to do so.  It would all depend on how you have things situated, but in a smaller computer desk, there isn't much extra cord.  I wouldn't keep the cord length from purchasing these again for their intended recipients, just be aware of the 5' cord.

In addition to this lack of durability, the keyboard sometimes misses letters that I type (apparently I type too fast for it, I'm around 65 WPM).

Amazon is the best, but they are not perfect.

That, alone, should be a category for free returns, if they aren't ever going to change their ways. And they aren't. Too busy launching rocket ships, I guess.

I needed four attributes: backlit, large print, Mac OS, full keys. And not cost a million dollars. That keyboard apparently does not exist. This KB is not Mac OS, which is stupid, because it takes very little coding to make a product accept 100% of situations rather than 75%.

I purchased this keyboard on April 4, 2016, and now two years later with daily use (>8hrs) it is still working with only a couple of very minor exceptions :

1) The left-side SHIFT key sticks every so often
2) The left-side CTRL key's surface is showing wear, this is probably due to how the plastic key cap is manufactured.,

Other than that the keyboard is works very well, and if I can get at least a couple more years of use out of it I would likely by another to replace it.

-------- Original Review ---------
I've been wanting a keyboard like this for some time now... I originally bought one at retail and was initially doubtful regarding how well the backlight and large print keys would work for me. But after plugging it in and using it for a few days my doubts disappeared. I purchased a 2nd one from Amazon.

The backlight brightness can be changed with a dial on the keyboard, additionally the color can be changed with a nearby button. Even with the light dimmed to its lowest setting(off)  the large print keys are easy to see in a reasonably lit room. The feel of the keys initially seems a bit clunky but that's easy to get used to and it seems that the clunkiness diminishes with use.

I like the layout of the keys, their size, and relative placement. The extra functions keys work without any special driver which is nice. The cord is a good length which is nice for reaching a PC under a desk and running the cable over the back of it. I also like the larger hand rest at the front of the keyboard, although if you've got limited space it might be an issue.

On some PCs the keyboard may stay lit when the PC is powered off. It's not a keyboard issue, the PC is powering the USB connectors.","Excellent keyboard, would purchase again.... (updated)",1460419200,

First it has to be the LOUDEST keyboard I have ever used in over 20 years of computing.  OH MY Gosh!  This is LOUD!  This thing is so loud that people in the next room might think you are having the roof re-shingled.  I have never understood why some people like loud keyboards, but if you are one of those people, you will love this keyboard. The second thing I don't like about this keyboard is the symbol layout.  The symbol (SHIFT function) is the opposite of every other keyboard I have ever seen.  The shift function symbol is on the bottom of the key, where as on every other keyboard, it is on the top.  This drives me crazy.  Other then these two things, the keyboard is fine.

Bottom line:  If you like loud keyboards with a non-standard symbol layout, this keyboard will do you fine.  If you are like me and like more quieter keyboards with a standard symbol layout, this keyboard is not for you.",Extreme LOUD with non-standard key symbol layout.,1458691200,

PROs:

1. Nice large font.
2. Illumination is good.
3. Keys are all in the ""normal"" place. Many of the illuminated keyboards move the backslash, make the enter, spacebar, and/or backspace key narrow, or otherwise put things in confusing places.
4. Can still see the text on the keys even with illumination all the way down.
5. No batteries required (it gets enough power from the USB).

CONs:
1. Wrist rest isn't removable, so it takes up a lot more desk space than I'd like
2. Keys seem to be recessed
3. Placement of the ""shifted characters"" is lower right on each key instead of the standard of putting it above
4. Keys are a bit loud
5. After 10 months, the cord became flakey and has to be wiggled a bit until there is a connection. Luckily, since the keyboard is illuminated it is easy to see when it is ""working"" again.
6. Minor nit: there's no English on the BACKSPACE key and no arrow on the TAB key.

NOTEs:
1. Some people have complained that a few of the keys start to stick after a month or three. Do what another Amazon reviewer mentioned and dab a small amount of petroleum jelly with a Q-tip!
2. If you can't tell from the pictures, there is a ""LED brightness wheel"" at the top right of the keyboard (5 color version of the product) which can dim the brightness all the way to ""off"". They wheel is totally recessed and there is no handle to break off. The small button to the right of this selects among the 5 colors.
3. Chromebox/Chromebook users: The Shortcut Keys at the top that work: Home, Bookmarks, Volume (up, down, mute), show all tabs, full screen.  The Shortcut Keys at the top that don't work: Mail, Play/pause, PrevTrack, NextTrack, Stop. The Music key (to the right of Mute) does something (flashes the screen) but doesn't seem to do anything useful.",This is the best of the corded illuminated keyboard choices,1458518400,

When I first plugged it in, the lights would stay on when the computer was turned off. Since this is a bedroom, it was not desirable.

I first ordered the 3 color and, because of some peculiar lighting and seating arrangement in my office workspace, was not happy with the limited range of colors and visibility of the keys. I did, however, find the quality of the product to be pretty good compared to others I had looked at. Azio claims in their advertising that the chartreuse on the 5-color model is more highly visible than the other colors, so I ordered that model with the intent of returning the 3 color board if the 5 color better suited my needs. What I found was that the 5 color, though similar, is clearly made by another manufacturer and is inferior to the 3 color keyboard in almost every respect.

I wanted to get a backlighted keyboard for my recording studio as the control room is dimly lighted. Overall appearance of the keyboard looks grate. The letters and numbers are defiantly large! Letters are about 3/8 inch in tall and the numbers function keys are about 5/16 inch tall. The numeric key pad numbers are also about 3/8 inch tall along with the arrow keys. There are some other keys at the top, launch email client, browser home, add page to favorites, along with media player keys, volume and mute, launch media player, my computer, calculator, and change backlight color. There are some dray backs I discovered! The indicator lights for Num lock, caps lock scroll lock are sit do low inside the key board and are hard to see unless you look directly down at the keyboard. Also the lighted keys are brightest looking directly over the keyboard. There is a rest at the bottom of the keyboard or at least I think thats what it is. Its about 1 3/8 wide and runs the width of the key board. The problem is that the pads on the bottom do not touch the surface of a desk and it slides around. There are another set if pads under the keyboard directly behind the first set that don't touch the desk at all unless you drop the first set over the edge of the desk. Looking at the underside of the keyboard it looks as though the rest could be removed but unfortunately you cant remove it. I just dropped the first set of pads over the edge of the audio mixers desk and it works just fine. The legs under the keyboard to tilt it could stand to be just a little longer.

I am on my PC 8 to 10 hours a day with constant use of the keyboard. The keys are so plain to see and the letters do not rub off as they do on conventional keyboards. As far as the sticking keys I have seen complaints about? I've had one stick so far and did what one of the users suggested: popped the key off and put so petroleum jelly on the backside of it; problem solved! I also read that the keys seem larger than normal but I do not think this is the case, I believe it is the perception because the lettering is so nice and large.  I am a touch typist at over 85 wpm and have not had any slow downs because of the keyboard at all. Another mentioned the angle of the keyboard and it needing to be propped up more on the rear; I thought so at first too but after a couple of days I realized that my wrist were at a much better angle than ever before and I do not have the typing fatigue as I used to have!

I do not believe you can go wrong purchasing this keyboard. It has proven itself to me and if and when it succumbs to old age I hope to replace it with another one exactly like it!

A problem with this keyboard is that the key identifiers for the character with the shift key depressed are reversed. So instead of the & showing at the top of the 7 key it is at the bottom. Where this can get quite confusing is with the characters for comma, quote, apostrophe, etc. where the normal orientation is that the character at the bottom of the key is the one that will be typed normally and the one at the top is generated with the use of the shift key.

There is a also a firmware bug that causes the Paragraph notation to be switched on with Microsoft Word when using the shift key inside the program. More than a little annoying to have to keep turning this back off.

It is the noisiest keyboard I have ever encountered in my 33 years of typing on a wide range of OEM and third party keyboards.

When I copy text or compose stories and things like reviews I don't need to look at the keys.

I've opened two of these and Azio packs this keyboard in a nice, sleek black box with the keyboard wrapped, cord concealed below a cardboard flap, and instructions included.

***PROs***
Solid design: later revisions offer a hefty feel, pleasant textures, and lite/fast key response. The dedicated multimedia buttons all work on the two I purchased. There is a sixth (hidden) color, green. You can get it by switching to Cyan and dimming down about 1/2. No drivers needed: (I can vouch for Win7 and Win8.1) and all the lighting controls are on the keyboard itself, not in some program.

***CONs***
No USB passthru, No Audio Ports, No Detachable cable. The textures make this device a DUST MAGNET!

***Usage***
I've had this keyboard for a couple months, but a family member has had one for around six months. Neither are showing any signs of ware.

***Summary***
For what you pay (less than $30) this is a good keyboard. It will NOT impress anyone used to mechanical switches (or RGB backlighting) as the keypress offers minimal feedback and if you press to bedrock, this thing gets loud.

We keep our desktop in our living room and occasionally use it when watching television.  The backlit keyboard comes in handy in the darkened room.

We use Amazon for most of our purchases and I update my reviews if anything changes with the products. I do this so other Amazon users can get a real feel for the life of the product. I am not associated with any company and all opinions are my very own.

Update:  2-26-2015  8 months later and the space bar is sticking.  Very annoying? We don't eat or drink at the computer, so I know we didn't cause it.  I have tried turning the keyboard upside down and blowing it out with canned air, but that didn't fix it. The keyboard has a 3 year warranty, so I just emailed the company as that is one of the contact options for them.  They responded back within 3 hours asking for more information and then emailed a prepaid shipping label for me to send the keyboard back.

I have never been a touch typist. Many have told me I am a pecker, I need to see the keys (but I'm sure that's not what they meant, since they have never seen me type).  I no longer have to turn on the lights in order to while away on the computer at night, which pleases my not insignificant other. I'm never sure if she's happier that I don't have the lights on when performing ... my computering OR she's happy that I can use the computer instead of bothering her in bed. She also calls me a pecker but she's seen me type.

Hitting the keys is mildly noisy, but she wears ear plugs to drown the sounds of traffic, the incessantly yapping neighbors' dog, the exaltations from the newlyweds next door, and the random gunshots ...  outside. I actually like the sound of the keys, it makes my think I'm actually doing some work. The illuminated letters, numbers, and symbols are large and clear. The symbols on the hotkeys on the top row should be a bit larger. The only button not illuminated is the one for changing the color (blue, red, purple), which is of no consequence.

The only mild complaint is the size and weight of the keyboard. It is heavier and larger than the keyboard it replaces. I use of of those bed wedges sold by Amazon so I can sit up in bed and use the bedroom TV as a monitor, even though there are much more enjoyable uses of both a bed and bed wedges. The keyboard leaves little room for my mouse on the lapdesk. I spend considerable time groping around trying to locate my errant mouse (at least that's what I tell my not insignificant other, unless it's upside down, the mouse, that is.

All in all, except for my personal pecadildos, I would recommend this to others. Of course this is only after a few days of satisfied use. Durability may cause me to refine my assessment.",I'm never sure if she's happier that I don't have the lights on when performing,1429142400,

This keyboard does that as well as can be expected.
I haven't used it much, so can't really attest to the long-life quality of the illumination or the keys. (will update review when that time comes)

The keys are most definitely not mechanical - they are soft - like a low-end laptop.  I thought it was going to be problematic, but then again I don't use the computer for heavy-duty word processing.  Works perfectly ok for e-mails and whatnot.
I am mostly used to the Logitech solar or their other wireless keyboard sets.  Where they aren't mechanical, but have a bit stiffer response on the keys.  This keyboard types very similar to the Microsoft Desktop 800 set:  http://www.amazon.com/dp/B003SVSJ1K

I have one issues that several folks have mentioned. There is something about how the keys are placed that make it easy to mistype. I seem to miss-hit keys way more often with this keyboard layout than my old keyboard. With the keys having less travel, wider key tops and spaced closer together it slows down my typing. My fingers seem to always be slipping over the key top and depressing the next key. I would say I'm a average typist  but it seems harder to correctly strike the keys without looking, less forgiving than my previous keyboard. I like the lighted keys but I'm not sure it's worth the speed reduction in typing. So thumbs up for construction, ergonomics & lighted keyboard but lose one star for usability.

[11/12/15 update] I've used this keyboard for 6 months now and I've lowered it one star for one overriding fact, the keys. These low depression chick-let style keys have caused the number of miss typed words to skyrocket. I can't type a complete sentence without a extra <CR> or letter being inserted somewhere. Not much space between keys and if your finger is not exactly in the middle of the key a slight key depression off center gets the next key over letter.

I also like that you can turn off the illumination by holding down the color change button for at least 3 seconds, so if you have the keyboard in an area where you may want darkness, you won't have the keyboard lighting up your room when it's unused.  The keys are very low profile, more so than a typical desktop keyboard, but not quite as much as a laptop, so it may cause you to miskey sometimes.  Also, for some reason, I can't quite get used to the layout of the INS/HM/DEL.... keys.  It's very different than my Logitech K350 keyboard, which I've grown accustomed to and quite fond of, so I can never use those keys without having to look down at the keyboard.  Another gripe is that I am not able to find drivers for this keyboard model.  I went to the manufacturer's website, and there are driver for other models, but not this one. Because of that, all of the multimedia keys do not work, and there's no way to program/assign the few that do.  Volume and mute work, but none of the play/pause keys for music or video apps.  The browser home key does work, and it will work with your default browser, the button to open a new browser works also, but it creates a separate window instead of adding a tab to Chrome.  It would be nice if the multimedia keys all worked, which I really like to use to pause/skip tracks, but it wasn't a deal breaker.  So just be aware, the keys are very flat, and you probably won't be able to find drivers to help with keys that aren't working.  One more thing, the small rubber feet along the front edge fell off.  The 1st one fell off within a day or two, and I was constantly sticking it back on (it had some sticky residue on it) but the problem is that they are so woefully skinny, that there is just not enough contact area to make a secure stick to the bottom of the keyboard.  I should have used some hot glue, but I just kept putting it off, so now both of my feet are gone and the keyboard will slide easily on my wooding keyboard tray.  Other than those small gripes, it's a decent keyboard for a very low price.","It gets the job done, with some caveats",1428105600,

The keys are large & friendly, and are easy to press.  They are not chiclet-style keys but are low-depth regular style, which is as advertised.  So, the keys are slightly noisier than chiclet keys but they are easy to press & are fluid nonetheless - and they might possibly be easier to clean than chiclets.  I actually think the colors look even prettier on the actual keyboard than they do in the pictures.  The yellow color doesn't seem as loud and has an interesting & eye-catching hue of green also.  The turquoise has a compelling aquamarine tropical tone.  Seems the green tone comes out on the yellow & turquoise colors when the lighting is dimmed via the wheel. The blue is a perfect standard color, but with just a slight hint of a midnight afterglow.  In fact all the colors come through  to splendid effect & are eye-catching, but not loud, & easy on the eyes.  Very beautiful colors indeed.  The brightness wheel is a nice touch too: I like this feature.  The three-color version doesn't have the brightness wheel though I don't suppose that would matter much for people who are looking for a well-lit keyboard.  The function keys are grouped, also a nice design touch, and there's also a calculator key which I do find useful also.  The layout of the keyboard is perfect in my opinion.  I also do like the spacing of the keys.  There's ample room between keys & I can maneuver my fingers adequately.  Back-lit keyboards have been known to have a key coat that wears off with usage so we'll see how well the key lettering holds up.

I can't touch type so I need to see. The lights were great, but the keyboard had sticking and non responding keys right out of the box. Thankfully there is an undo command for my email. I hit the delete key to remove one message and it promptly wiped out the entire inbox because the key stuck, but not in a visible way that I could see and pull it up. Then the R and the S didn't work at all. The other keys were random, some worked, some didn't, some stuck. I had to plug the old one back in to type a message to Amazon to return it.

I returned it immediately for a full refund (thank you for standing behind products Amazon!), but I am going to try once more to get one that works. I really liked the lights and large print. My dream keyboard is wireless, backlit and large print with dedicated multimedia hot keys (that don't require 2 hands to use, as in FN + another key like the Logitech ones) NO one makes one with all these features. I have searched and searched. If someone knows of one I would be pleased to hear it!

My new one should ship today so I will update this review or write another when it arrives. This company needs to find out the run numbers on these bad ones and get them off the market!

*********************UPDATE DEC 2016*********************************
I received the ""newer"" version of this keyboard that is all blue keys as pictured (my original review was for the multicolored one). Worked great at first, but now is not registering every key stroke and the light turns of randomly while I am typing. I have to pretty well stomp the keys to be sure they all register, and then be sure to proofread everything I write very carefully. I have already corrected 3 mistakes in the above sentence due to letters not registering! Roughly 4 months. That's pretty crappy life span for a person that types a few little ditties on Facebook and the occasional email. If someone who actually types a lot had this it would have failed much sooner I am sure.

I just checked and I am past the Amazon return window so I am now stuck with it or at the mercy of whatever warranty the company offers. Wasted my money. I will have to drag out the old Compaq keyboard that I have used since 1999 or so. The keys were starting to stick on that finally and I wanted backlit for my tired eyes. Guess I will keep on searching.","1st one defective out of box, 2nd failing in 4 months!",1425859200,

Gray,I like the large letters and that it's lighted. The problem I have with this keyboard is that the keys are flat which makes it very easy to hit 2 letters at the same time. It does the job since it replaces a Dell keyboard that I have had for nearly 10 years. If I had it to do over I would pay closer attention to the details of the key.

I never realized just how dark it was to type when using my computer. But one day it dawned on me to replace it with a lighted keyboard.
So... I of course researched Amazon and found ""this three colored lighted keyboard"". Although it generally rated well, there still were reviews all over the place which made me reluctant at first. Sticky keys seemed to be the big issue. Hmmm....
Well one person complained about this but said he removed the offending keys and lubricated them with small amount of petroleum jelly. This made his keyboard the greatest thing since sliced bread.
So it least there seemed to be a potential cure of this product dilemma, and I ordered one.
It came and I hooked it up and mine seems to be fine out of the box with no problems at all.
Surprisingly (at least to me) is that the purple color is the most usable out of the three colors. Blue and red are too intense and the purple (more lilac really) seems gentler on the eyes. The keyboard does default to blue when starting up, but no big deal.
Based on my experience and most current reviews, the sticky key issue seems to have been addressed.

Its the Azio Large Print Tri-Color Backlit Wired Keyboard, and I really like it.

This wired USB keyboard has over-sized, backlit letters that are extremely easy to see, even when you're sitting in total darkness. That makes it great for night owls who enjoy using their computer while their significant other sleeps nearby in a darkened bedroom.

Since its currently selling for less than $25 on Amazon, I didn't know what to expect from this keyboard in terms of quality, but after plugging it in and trying it out, I can tell you that it seems to be well-built. And the three year warranty gives me a warm, fuzzy feeling.

This keyboard is heavier than the typical modern computer keyboard, and I like that because the extra weight helps keep it from sliding around while Im typing. Im guessing the added weight is due to the extra components that perform the backlighting.

Theres a button located on the upper right-hand corner of the keyboard that, when pressed, changes the backlight color from blue to red to purple each time you press it.

After trying all three colors, I decided to leave it set to purple because that color seems to provide the most contrast. Pressing and holding the color change button for three seconds turns off the backlighting altogether. Pressing the same button again turns the backlighting back on.

In addition to the oversized backit keys (which I love!), there is also a row of Hotkey buttons above the function keys that perform a variety of functions.

After using this keyboard for a while, I have found that the only Hotkey buttons I use on a regular basis are the ones that raise and lower the speaker volume, open the My Computer dialog, and take me to my browers home page. Im sure plenty of other folks will find the remaining buttons useful as well however.

One thing that I really should mention is this isn't a silent keyboard. The keys make a definite clicking sound when pressed.

This clicking sound is no louder than the clicks you hear with most regular keyboards, but if you plan to use it while someone else is trying to sleep, the slight noise could be a problem if that person happens to be a very light sleeper.

Bottom line: Overall, I really like this keyboard. I do enjoy working with the light in my office turned off on occasion, and the large, backlit keys make it extremely easy and comfortable to do so. In my opinion, this is a great keyboard for the money.",This is a great keyboard for the money.,1423267200,

I have to agree with some of the other reviews, when you first get this, the keys are strikingly big. HOWEVER, the reason I bought this keyboard is so at night, specifically I can see keys without having all the lights on in my office. IT DOES THAT PERFECTLY. If the keys were smaller the light would not be effective.

So for me, this keyboard has been great, no issues, great colors, the capability to dim and shut off the keyboard light if necessary.the extra function keys are cool as well. The only thing I can think of that might make for a feature is ""custom"" function keys.

Was packaged in a regular box. Had some paper in it, but the paper wouldn't do anything to protect the keyboard. Getting the black box out of the outer box proved to be a little difficult. It is quite a tight fit. Opened up the black box and WOW those are some big letters! Even with the light off you can see how big the letters are. Plugged it into my KVM switch and on comes the light. Now you really can see the letters. Did I mention that they are some big letters?

 The keys make a little noise when typing on them, but I tend to be hard on a keyboard, so, you may not experience the noise. They feel great, easy to type with. The keys are fairly level with each other from row to row, sort of like a laptop keyboard. The keyboard does  have legs in the back that raise it, for me, a comfortable level. It does have rubber rectangles on the bottom and doesn't seem to move while typing.

 The one I bought has 5 colors, turquoise, green, blue, red and purple . Each color has a different light level to it, just because of the color. I personally like the turquoise and blue. My keyboard came with a disk on the upper right hand side, next to the light button, of the keyboard. This allows you to dim then level of light. So you can dim the light if you want to. I read in other comments and questions if you could dim the light, everyone said no, but I can. If you feel the need to turn off the light you just hold down the light button for about 3 seconds or so and the light turns off. To turn it back on, just push the light button and the light will come back on. Even in a well lit room, you still can see the colors of the keyboard.

 Special keys at the top. I rarely have any luck with these keys. I run Linux Ubuntu 14.04 64bit. Most keyboard software, if not all of it, is for Windows. However, I gave them a try. The E-mail button does open my E-mail program, and then was much rejoicing. The Home button doesn't work. The star button, no idea what it really is for, just makes my browser bar in Chrome go away and come back.  The next set of keys are for audio. The play button works, but does not call up my music player. The previous button works. The next button works. The stop button works. The next set of buttons are for volume control. The first one to turn down the volume works. The next one to turn up the volume works. The third button, the mute button works fine. The next pair of buttons look like music and computer. The music button does not bring up my music player. The second button, that looks like a monitor, bring up my files windows, which would be like your explorer window. The final button all the way to the right is a calculator button, it brings up my calculator just fine. Over all, with past experiences with these types of buttons, I am extremely please that most of them work. I am hoping to eventually get all of them to work.

 I was down to 6 keyboards that light up. Two of them had only five star ratings, but only five reviews. The others had a higher percentage of one star ratings than this one. Overall I am extremely satisfied with this keyboard. I also bought the extended 2 year warranty. I haven't found any problems with it yet.

Yes, it was finally time to get something new.... one key was sticking, and the letters were finally coming off due to game play.

I like typing on this keyboard.  Sounds are similar.... at least there is some noise.... I have used other KBs that were just plain quiet, and did not like it.  The keys are a little closer together, and my hands are large - it did not take long to get used to .... still OK.

The letters are LARGE.... yea.  I am at the point where I am needing reading glasses.... this puts that off for a while ... lol.  You can have NO back lighting of the keys, or, you can set them to Red, Blue, Purple with the push of a button.  Hold the button, and all colors shut off.  **  update  **  You will need to have the key light turned on.  There is no ""white"" key labels when the lights go out.  It will be too dark for you to see...especially if you are getting this keyboard because of your eyes.

I plugged it in and the drivers loaded... I am using Windows 7.

Special keys above the function keys are nice.... I clicked on the mail button and BAM, my email came up.  Click on home and BAM, ,my home page loaded.  A nice touch.

I played my FPS game..... and found that it played well.  It was similar to my old Gateway KB.

The keyboard has some weight to it.... so it has a 'value' feel to it.

This is still early, but I must say that I like the keyboard thus far.

My star ding is primarily for the hand rest.... it is not removable, and I find that for me it interferes with the space bar.....not a biggie, but for me I'd like to see it moved down away from the space bar.  ** update**  Now I see why I mentioned this... the keys are not much higher than the hand rest.  If you place a ruler from top to the bottom of the keyboard, the keys are only about 1/8 inch above the bottom of the ruler.

Also, the cord is short vs other keyboards that I have used..  It's OK, and for me it worked because my setup is close to the USB connection.  The cord length is one the short side of 5 feet long... .  The cord comes out of the right top portion of the keyboard.  Measure your current keyboard cord, and try this length to see if your setup will work with this keyboard.

Overall this is a nice keyboard.  And, for the price, I like it a lot.

**** Update 8/15/2015 ****  Three of the keys are losing the paint, so, I cannot see what the letter is.  Only been eight months..... soon will need another, and will look for an alternative.",Replaced my Original 80s Gateway KB.....Good value.,1419465600,

Ahlberg,"Overall, an excellent keyboard for the money.  Of all the under $20 keyboards I've bought in the last 10 years (12) or new PCs I've bought this has to be the best keyboards so far.

I've lately chosen these illuminated-style keyboards because to me they are a sort of throwback to the days when the letter on each key was a cast-in actual letter rather than some cheap paint that wears off after a few months.  I spend 8 to 12 hours each day using keyboards on multiple computers as part of my job so tactile feedback and clear lettering are important.  Previous illuminated keyboards I've tried have had poor layouts where the backspace key or the return/enter key were not well placed or shaped for my expectations and the keys were wobbly or lacked good tactile feedback (in my 50th year of using keyboards nearly every day!).

Frankly, I wasn't expecting this keyboard to be an improvement but based on other reviewers comments, and the fact that Azio makes some products for Gamers, which means to me that they consider durability important, I decided to try two of these since I have two workstations I use every day, one through a 4 port KVM switch.  So far these keyboards have proved to excellent.

The key feel is excellent with the keys exhibiting no wobble and having a light but solid feel and just enough travel to ensure good tactile feedback.

This keyboard is superior to some of the name brand products I've tried from Microsoft and Logitech.  Admittedly, my trials of the Microsoft and Logitech keyboards were for some of their cheapest products and I still like those brands for many hardware products (Love my Harmony Remote from Logitech!) but this Azio keyboard is easily their equal or better in quality and features.

I thought the colored backlighting was theatrical rather than functional - I was really looking for key lettering that couldn't rub off - but I already like the illumination.  If you type like I do where you're moving back and forth between mousing for things and digging through paperwork and then going back to the keyboard then you'll appreciate the illumination as a bright visual clue to hand position.  I like that a lot already.  I had envisioned leaving the illumination off (Thanks to another reviewer for pointing out how to turn it off!) but now find I like it. The large letters make this an easy keyboard to return to from doing other tasks at my desks.

Time will tell how durable these keyboards are but they feel great and look great now!!",Excellent low-cost keyboard!,1417737600,

Chambers,"Mute button didn't work at first. The mute button is great for killing those darn pop-up noisy adverts.

So I unplugged the old keyboard, leaving just a single keyboard, re-booted. No problem now.

I'm a heavy-duty typer, but I do glance at the keyboard from time to time. The N key had entirely worn off the old keyboard, and typing in a dark room was iffy. The new one seems ok for now. The keys are somewhat nicely dimpled, despite reports from some reviewers that they were ""flat"".  And they'll never have the nice feel of the old steel IBM PC keyboards, made in America by Americans, what a novel idea...

I must recommend this to my mother, who has macular degeneration.

The large print suits me well. Even if I did have better eyesight, I just think the large print looks good. I know some people have commented on the print being ridiculously large, but go big or go home, I say. I like it. The colors are good, too. The red is like a cherry red. The blue is more like a cerulean, though. So don't get this thinking that it will be a dark blue or a royal blue. The purple is lighter than I imagined as well. More light-pinkish almost, with just enough hint of red and blue to call it purple.

Overall, I recommend this. And I would probably recommend their newest model, which has five colors I believe. That model wasn't out when I bought this one, but I'm perfectly fine with this one. Types smoothly. Keys are low, almost like laptop keys (which I prefer), and it has all the media keys that I use - music player keys (play/pause, back, forward, stop), volume up and down and a mute, a my document/computer key, and a calculator button.

So I started looking for alternatives, since I don't like the fluorescent lights in my office, so I have them removed from the fixtures.  So it's nice to have an illuminated keyboard for cloudy days, or in the winter when the days are shorter and there's less ambient light.

I liked the fact that this had three colors, but oddly enough, there's no off option short of unplugging it.  I use a Thinkpad Yoga tablet computer, so I have this plugged into a USB 3 docking station, not directly into the computer.  Since that's always on, this is lit all the time.  I would've liked to have seen the color cycle selector also include an ""off"" option.

The LED clear parts for the lettering was really bad, lots of striations so there's a lot of lines in the letters, it's not just one smooth, consistent glow unless you're directly over it looking straight down.

The space bar is a bit below the level of the back edge of the front curved palm rest - which is a horrible design since every time I hit the space bar, the joint on my thumb hits that plastic.  After a while of fast touch typing, it begins to get a bit sore and annoying.

The LED's for num lock, caps lock, and scroll lock are very, very recessed in the case, so you can barely even see the indicator lights unless you're directly above looking down. Right now, with it on my desk in a ""normal"" position in front of me, even in a dark room with no sun out (pre-dawn) and no lights in my office I can barely tell the num lock is on from my typing position.

Key travel is a bit mushy, but not so much so that it would have impacted my rating had there been no other problems.

All told, this was returned very, very quickly.  I had used it long enough to write this review and then set up the return to Amazon right after that.  Oddly enough, the replacement unit I chose was also an Azio, which earned four stars.  So it's not necessarily a problem with the company and their products overall, just this one keyboard that I really couldn't stand.",Bad rise in palmrest means banging the thumb joint on it every time you hit the space bar,1414022400,

My husband has a gaming keyboard that lights up and I wanted one too. This little baby is a gem at $24.99! (His was 3x the cost as it had a lot of gaming features). I bought one for myself as I wanted a keyboard that lit up to make the letters easier to see  when I am typing in the dark. I periodically change the colors between the purple, blue, and red,; a nice function. My husband's light up keyboard is only blue. I have had this keyboard for 2 years and have not had any problems with it.

I subsequently purchased a keyboard for my in-laws. They don't have the best eye sight and had trouble typing.  not only is it helpful that the keyboard lights up, but the large print is a great benefit to them. The letters are twice the size of a normal keyboard, making it way easier to see. Now they are fighting over who uses the desktop instead of the laptop.

The first, had keys that ""stuck"" and were hard to press. I found myself missing a lot of keys when typing. Not good for a programmer. I returned it to Amazon and bought another from a third-party seller. That one seemed fine, until around 30 - 45 days and keys started sticking again. I called Azio customer support and the rep told me that there was a bad batch of keyboards manufactured that had keys that were molded .5 - 1mm off spec. He did an advanced replacement for me and the new keyboard seems much more fluid than either of the old. Impressively, in the box with the advanced replacement was a prepaid return label, a card thanking me for my business, and a roll of Smarties candy. This was better support than I've received from the majority of manufacturers out there. Now on to the keyboard.

The keyboard itself is decent. Not as solidly built as a MS Sidewinder or eluminX, but sturdier than a logitech K120. It has a similar form factor to the sidewinder, and if I didn't know any better, I may call it a Sidewinder ""clone"" at 1/3 the price. The surface of the keyboard (not the keys) is a rubberized material, as found on some mice these days. Not sure if it adds any traction, but does get shiny in spots from the oils in my fingertips.  Not a big deal. There are nipples on the F, ,J, and 5 (keypad) keys for those proper typists out there. I don't use the macro keys so can't comment on those, but the keyboard works fine in MacOS otherwise. I don't find myself having any difficulty with typing, but I'm used to the likes of laptop-ish eluminX and non-standard Sidewinder keyboards.

The illumination is awesome. The large print keys are awesome also, Who'd have ever guessed to make letters that fill the size of the key instead of tiny print in the upper left corner? Not everyone is a 20 year old Californian with perfect vision and a state mandated tribal armband tattoo. These keys are visible, and dimmable via the dial in the upper right. Cyan or Yellow works well during the day for extra visibility, and red or purple or any other color for night.

The only thing ""weird"" about the keys is that on keys with a caps function (E.g., 8 *, or 5 %), the caps character is at the bottom of the key instead of the top. When typing in a drunken or otherwise impaired stupor, I find myself second-guessing sometimes ... ""Wait, do I hold shift for a curly brace or square bracket?? I can't remember!!""

I just tried out the media keys in MacOS and the following work for iTunes: play/pause, vol +/-, skip back, skip fwd, and mute. Shortcuts and macros don't seem to work out of the box. Not sure if there is software or configuration required.

All in all this keyboard is worth the price I think. I'll update in 30-45 days and see how the keys hold up and if they start to stick at all. But for right now they're smooth.

UPDATE: 10/28/2014
Still no issues. The replacement is still going strong. I've played a little Skyrim with it and it works fine, of course, I'm no Korean Starcraft player executing 180 moves per minute.","Good Keyboard, Excellent Customer Service",1409702400,

Pros: Well lit keys, easy to read.
Cons:
1) The keys require a much stronger typing motion than the standard keyboard. Often i miss characters in words because i am not pushing down hard enough. It is very annoying. I am constantly correcting spelling on common words.
2) The key height is much shorter than a standard keyboard. If you look at the keyboard from the side, the keys are maybe only 1/16 inch higher than the keyboard case itself. For me this made it more difficult to find the keys, since the gap between the keys is less discernible.

You may have to smash one to get it to move but the one right next to it has no troubles moving so both end up getting pressed. I would say the company needs to focus on inspections and quality control.

Follow up: I have no faith in Amazon 5 start reviews anymore. To me it seems like people who are ok with made in China junk are driving these reviews. This keyboard for instance is a complete waste of money and falls in line with all the other 1 star reviews about the keyboard: made of low density polyethelene that warps and mashes other keys in normal use. This is NOT even of sufficient quality to call it a ""home office"" keyboard, in fact it would be drive the cost of doing business up because you have to correct the errors the keyboard causes.

QUALITY IS PART OF VALUE! When the quality is so bad you throw it away at less than 10% of the life of a comparable keyboard for the same price, it is no value.","The price is to make you think its a legit product, its a disposable though.",1405296000,

There are two items I need to mention about design and quality control.  First, the volume buttons are reversed, meaning the + button actually is placed on the left, and lowers the volume.  The - buttons, on the right, actually increases the volume.  I've tried to remove and swap them, but they won't budge, so they may be part of a continuous rubber membrane underneath the plastic template.  This should not have left the factory this way.  I may have to return the keyboard for a replacement.

Secondly, the flip-out tabs on the bottom rear do not raise the keyboard very high.  This leaves the board essentially still in a ""flat"" horizontal position, which is cumbersome while typing.  I had to add some material under the tabs to make the rear higher.  I should not have to make this adjustment either.  Otherwise, the switchable colors and lettering is easy to see, even in the dark.

In the past I've paid 3x what this keyboard cost just to have the letters fade away in less than a year. At this price, that's OK. At $60 it's not.

Pros:
I can read this without my glasses day or night.
The layout is standard.
Color change button is easy to use.
The replacement keyboard is still a little clunkier than I'm used to, but I've been on my laptop so much that a regular keyboard feels weird.

Cons
I had to order a replacement because the first keyboard was defective. Normally I'd not take a star off for that, but since the manufacturer knows of the defect and still sells the bad lot through Amazon Azio is losing a star. That's just crappy customer service, and I'm now forced to drop the bad one off at the UPS store to be returned to Amazon. It's not fair to Amazon or to me the consumer.

EDIT (a few weeks later)
Screw this keyboard. I am sending it back too. The 2nd one was better than the first, but it's just not useful. I'm a writer. I don't need to backspace every other word because the keys stick, which causes more typos than it does correct words.

I program for fun in my off hours- bottom line= I spend a thousands of hours at a keyboard.  I wanted a keyboard that was easy to read in the dim light, and this Azio 505U nails that requirement at 5 stars.  So why the two star rating?  It PAINED me to finally re-install my older Microsoft 3000 Keyboard simply because the keystrokes on the Azio caused me to generate so many typo's it became intolerable.  Gang- I WANTED to keep this keyboard.  I used it with fervor for 1 week, but i could not deny my productivity fell through the floor.

The bottom line= the Azio Key stroke is exceptionally ""long"", meaning you have to press each key down, and the stroke down is significantly longer (maybe 2x) that of a high end keyboard.  The number of times I had to stop typing and back up to re-strike a key (because I didn't force it down far enough) didn't get any better after one week.  I realized the only way I was going to make this work was to slow my type rate down considerably; and hey- this should be a tool to enhance productivity, not diminish.

The backlight does shut of if you hold the color button for a few seconds, and in normal light the letters are still easy to see.  Would recommend to a friend looking for a backlit keyboard.

Cons: the light button is not lit, so you need to turn the light on before the room is dark, and it is not as easy to locate it in the dark to change the color.  Not a big deal to me personally.

The bright keys are soft-touch and the feel of the keys is spot on. It is very well-designed to do the task it says it will. I have many keyboards--including others with backlighting. They mostly have small characters on keys and faint light. This one--is the exception--and it has a brightness control as well. The plastic keyboard is FLAT black--and does not have any annoying glare. It is a quality keyboard all the way around. I read all the reviews before ordering--and found that none of the mentioned complaints to be valid for me. And the keys certainly do not stick--they are excellent. I highly recommend--for anyone. There is really no conceivable reason for letters to be tiny on a keyboard--nor has there ever been. I suppose touch-typists from the old school might be a reason--but they do not look at them anyway.

I think it is the best keyboard I have ever had--and I have had keyboards on computers (mainframes) since the late 1960's. Of course, I am old--as you might imagine.

There are various quick function keys like mail, calculator, vol up, vol dwn, mute, play, pause, etc. The labeling on the keys is also better, not cryptic - prnt scrn, scrl lock, page up, page down, home, etc. As others commented with the 3-color keyboard, I also had some keys that would stick down from time to time but they all seemed to work themselves out with use - except the delete key. If I used the key it would stick bottomed out and I had to lift it back up with a hooked piece of wire. I took a chance and ran the hocked wire around the underside of the delete key and found a small plastic bur that easily came off. The key hasn't stuck since then. Now the only difficulty I have remaining is getting my hands use to the subtle key size changes from my old logitech keyboard. I like that the keyboard is usb hard wired. I don't have to worry about the keyboard batteries going dead due to the lighted keys. I never really moved my old logitech wireless keyboard more than a few inches from my monitor. Now a wireless mouse I understand. So even with the stuck key problem I had initially, I gave this keyboard 5 stars. I actually love it. I think the newer keyboard may have less problems than the tri-colored version. Just my two cents worth.",This review is for the Azio 5-color keyboard,1396656000,

It's fairly quite in operation, the keys just a bit ""slick"" to touch, but for the money it's a great value. So impressed with it my mother is having me order one for her just as soon as I post this review. All in all an excellent price for this board. One thing to note - turn the backlight OFF when not in use. LEDs fatigue, especially if they are not heat sinked properly, and I doubt they've done anything to draw heat away from them to prolong life. So if you want it to stay bright, turn off the lights when not in use.

Large print helps (since I need a new prescription for my glasses). I haven't had any problem with key-bounce (complaint in other reviews) causing double entries. Although this complaint might have more to do with the feel of the keyboard than anything else. And to that point in my opinion, this keyboard is more sensitive to touch. Up until this keyboard, I've been using a Belkin F8E206 and the impression I have is the Azio requires less pressure. And this is the one characteristic I feel is noteworthy. If you're moving from a keyboard like a Belkin (which has taller keys caps), you'll have an adjustment to make re the ""feel"" of the keyboard. These key caps are a lower profile; not chiclet style, but something in between. It does require a little adjustment. But if I can make the adjustment (using it for several weeks now), I think most people should do fine.

The only nit-picky comment I have is I don't need all the extra function keys across the top. I'd rather have a keyboard that takes up a little less space.

Otherwise, it's all good so far.

The size of the keyboard is slightly larger than the past keyboards I have had, which makes it a little difficult to type the same way.  I bought this keyboard because my old one was getting glitchy with the MMORPG I play, but the spacing of some of the keys (like distance between TAB to ESC) makes it hard to play normal.  If your hands are small, you will need to stretch and move your hands off keys to type.

The WORST part about for me with this keyboard is that MANY of the keys are not easily pressed.  It's like it gets hung up along the sides or something.  I spend almost as much time backspacing to insert letters or spaces that did not get typed as I do actually typing.  It's very annoying and I am thinking of popping some keys off to see if I can file off any extra plastic that might be grabbing/grinding against them.

4297,B00I0S6SK0,Azio Vision Backlit USB Keyboard with Large Print keys and 5 Interchangeable Backlight Colors (KB506) - Wired,2.0,,True,"03 28, 2014",A314ZLRAHHWEPZ,{'Style:': ' 3 Color'},Brian,"I'm writing this using the Azio Large Print Tri-Color Backlit Wired Keyboard just received from the good folks at Amazon, hoping I cover all my bases. In fact, I just removed a Logitech Illuminated keyboard from my PC--the keyboard I've been using for years--and I'll never use it again, not when there are alternatives like this available for a fraction of the price.

As I said, I have used the Logitech Illuminated keyboard for years, and have paid anywhere from $50 to $80 dollars for them (unfortunate, because it is a delicate plank that has never lasted long under my hands). They are wonderful for general typing, exceptionally comfortable and silent. In fact, the Logitech Illuminated is the most silent keyboard I have ever used. But they are horrid for gaming. Logitech engineered into the keyboard what is known as phantom key blocking to prevent gamers from using the SHIFT + W+ SPACE key combination, which is essential for any sort of competitive gaming experience. The idea was that gamers would then buy the more expensive Logitech gaming keyboards without key blocking. Keep in mind that keyboards do not generally have key blocking; it has to be engineered into them.

The problem with most gaming keyboards is that they are especially loud, and gaming keyboards with mechanical switches can be exceptionally loud. I stuck with the Logitech Illuminated keyboards only because I could find no better, silent alternative.

This  Azio keyboard does not have key blocking, making it more suitable for gaming than the Logitech Illuminated. If you play games, rest assured SHIFT + W + SPACE will work just fine, as it does on most any normal keyboard.

The backlighting is quite even top to bottom, left to right. The red seems striking and vivid. The blue has a touch of green and is slightly dimmer. The purple is closer to pink, and probably has to be; otherwise, it would prove too dark. Regardless, the purple is the most subdued of the three options. I also bought Azio's five-colored model as a backup and in case I fell in love with this one. The backlighting does not power down with the computer; it has to be switched off manually by depressing the LED ILLUMINATION button for three full seconds.

The key tops themselves have a fairly smooth, subtle texture I am immediately comfortable with. They have slightly more grip than the key tops on the Logitech Illuminated.

The key switches are soft and squishy. Key switches on the Logitech Illuminated are slightly less squishy. Squishy keys cause me problems when I get lazy and forget proper technique. It's rather like typing on a pillow or marshmallow, and the experience can lull the unwary into a laziness of sorts. I would compare the Azio unfavorably to the Perixx PERIBOARD with chicklet-style keys, another keyboard I received with my order. The PERIBOARD has the superior feel and responsiveness, better than the Logitech and far better than the Azio.

How loud the keyboard will be depends upon your technique. My technique is all over the map; with this Azio keyboard I can get dead-silent response one moment and CLICK! CLACK! BANG! the next. That is, it's fairly quiet if I hit the keys just right. Across the keyboard, keys have a varying responsiveness and a range of resistance I'm less than comfortable with. Bear in mind that, because I am writing a review, I am actively searching for something to fault. Someone with a heavy hand and no mind for silent operation would likely never notice. Personally, I'd prefer the keyboard had a lighter touch and more silent operation. This Azio keyboard is much louder than the Logitech Illuminated, which goes hand in hand with the uneven switch resistance.

I like the colors. I can change the colors of my keys by pressing a button? Seriously? For twenty dollars? I say, ""Wow!"" Oh, and the fact that the letters are supersized is probably a plus. I've entered the reading glasses stage of life, and the big letters are a good fit, as much as I hate to admit it.

The Q key tends not to register when gaming, a combination of my pinky strength and excess play in key travel. I can tell it's an inexpensive design. It has a bit of flex. It has squishy, wobbly keys. But I have to say that I cannot find anything better locally for twice the price. Not for three times the price. The black color accents the backlighting and makes the keyboard look fine with the lights on or off.

I recommend this keyboard as an emergency backup. If you want more color options and don't mind a slightly larger profile, look at the five-color version, which includes white backlighting. If you need a keyboard as quiet as the one on your laptop, look for something else. If you are not a discerning touch typist or finicky gamer, this keyboard is good enough.","Amazing price, looks nice, and it won't wake the dead!",1395964800,

Also, the stroke depth is inconsistent which makes touch-typing a challenge and the abbreviated 'specialty' key labels required for the large-print feature (Page Up =PU, Print Screen=PS, etc.) means I had to keep glancing at an old keyboard to recall which keys lived where.

Then I read a review that said it had 2 rubber feet in the front that held it in place really well, and when I looked under my keyboard I saw that my left foot was missing. Bummer for me. My second issue is that you have to manually turn it off when you turn off your computer. Hold down the LED ILLUMINATION button for a few seconds to do so. My third issue isn't a big one, but it's an issue. The keys are sticky. They aren't hard to push down, but they don't *click* when you push on them. I frequently miss keys because I didn't push it down all the way. Once I realized that I started pushing a little harder to make sure I was getting every keypress, but now my fingers are getting tired. I'll get used to it, but is just an annoying experience.

What I like about this keyboard are the huge letters and symbols. Heck, that's half the reason I bought it.

Since I am not a touch typist (more like search and destroy) being able to see the keys' letters is often necessary, especially in low light or with the near perpetual glare that plagues many workplaces. Now, it's easy because they are larger than life and illuminated from below.

Some criticism has been made regrading the amount of pressure required to depress the keys. I can see where someone with a light touch might be bothered but my style (see above) is aggressive and lacks any finesse. My heavy hand usually wears appliqu letters to invisibility long before I wish, especially ""A"" and ""S"" which is directly related to name-calling in letters to the editor.

The red light creates an aura of mystery in a darkened room that allows me to pretend that I am avoiding NSA's efforts to track me. Blue is less bright and purple more. All three colors enhance the visual part of one's typing experience. I like the keyboard and would recommend it highly to anyone with visual limitations (I'm 20/15 and 20/25) or where tired eyes make nighttime typing a drag. Actually, I like the keyboard just as a keyboard. Oh . . . and the spiffy ""Quick Access"" keys all work.

Update, two months later . . . After a month of regular use several letters/keys began emitting a ""click"" and did not depress as easily. Since I have faced this problem with other keyboards I used the same method to resolve the minor problem. With the PC shutdown and using my fingernails only (one nail under the upper side of the key and the other on the lower side) I carefully removed each key and applied a very light (VERY LIGHT) coating of mineral oil using cotton swabs; problem solved.

Pros: - Clear & bright illumination with an On & Off button
  -  Sturdy & tough plastic casing
  -  Great price ($20)
  -  Full size backspace button

Cons: - Keys are soft, not enough tension when pressing the keys while typing.
  -  Multimedia keys does not function at all (my Dell & Kensington both have working multimedia keys, no drivers required)
  -  No Sleep button!!! (all my other keyboard has a sleep button)

All in all, I like the LED back light, it is very nice looking. For typing it's so, so...and so far no sticking keys like what other reviews states. It would be very nice if the multimedia keys actually works, instead they just sit there as decorations!

Proper,"This is for an Azio large print lighted keyboard sold in 2014. This is not a heavily contoured keyboard, but it does have some shape to the keys.  The F&J nubs are very slight.  The large print is not obnoxiously big, by my standard.  It is a size that looks appropriate. Personally, I find standard keyboard lettering ridiculously tiny.

The layout is like a PC  106 keyboard, a time tested PC standard. The led brightness level does not seem adjustable on the 3-light model, but is not required. It is just the perfect level and you can easily see the keys in the dark.

However, the media keys are a bit undersized.  They work automatically with Windows 7 do not  actually require installation of any special software. Buttons include things like calculator, volume, internet, mail, play, pause, fast forward, music.  There are two each of: window keys, cntrl, and functions keys.

This is NOT a flat laptop keyboard, also it is not not mechanical or clickty type.  The key-throw is for a relaxed style of pressure, with a short-to-medium length and a solid landing.  Keys do not deviate twist or rock, they have a solid feel.

The base is solid, but could slide somewhat for some heavy handed users. They may want to add more rubber at the base..

The size and layout works nicely for  big or small hands. At recent prices, this keyboard is an excellent value.",No Room Lighting Required,1391904000,

However, due to the design, more and more keys of the keyboard were sticking if the keys were not pressed exactly in the center of each key. This faulty design continued to get worse with more use.

In a last-ditch effort, I pulled all the primary keys off and used a Q-tip and petroleum jelly to lubricate the slots where all the keys are installed.

The function buttons on top are useful, when they work - no software came with the keyboard, like Logitech, through which I can configure them.

A good note is how bright the keys are, and the three (3) LED color options are nice - Red's my favorite. If you hold down the LED key for a bit longer, it'll turn off the light all together.

The large font and backlighting is excellent. I really want to like this keyboard, but I had to get rid of it.

The issue is with how the keys depress. If you a pressing straight down from on top of the key, it seems fine. But as you type, you reach with fingers and often press keys at a bit of an angle. The keys on this keyboard don't respond well to this which means a key will not depress. So then you start typing with slightly more force than you're used to to make sure key presses all register. And the problem with that is this keyboard IS VERY LOUD if you type with a bit more force. So much so it wakes up my wife in the next room. It's like you start to press the key, it seems stuck, and then it suddenly ""gives"" and presses down with greater force - which contributes to the racket it makes..

Backlit keys are great for hunt and peck typers like me and the large font just makes it that much better. If only the keys didn't ""stick"" the way they do.

None of the keys have a smooth action ... I haven't pried up any yet to see the mechanics but I can tell just by feel they all have a loose-fitting post. With letter keys it's not a big deal, but for all the large keys (tab, shift, enter, etc. etc.) they have to be struck *exactly* perfectly dead center, with a perfectly vertical motion or the keys *will* stick / jam or otherwise fail to work as expected on the first strike.

If you expect to be able to type a lot and fast (say, 40 or 50 or more wpm) then this is not the keyboard for you.

Pros:  every key is backlit, choice of 3 colors, keys are nicely sized

1) I this is your first illuminated keyboard, your eyes may strain for the first day or two if you keep it beneath your computer's screen. Your eyes will adjust in due time.

2) The control buttons work with Windows 8.1 with no extra installations.

3) The keys press down slightly soft, unlike my old keyboard whose keys were rather resistant to my pushing. Once again I got use to that quickly.

4) The keyboard is definitely wider than that of my 15.6"" laptop, and my old ""full sized"" keyboard. This led to accidental key-presses, as noted by other uses. But I adjusted quickly.

5) If directly wired to your computer, the back-light will turn off with the computer, although it resets to blue once the PC powers on again despite your previous selection. I gave up and left them as blue because of this. If the lights do not turn off, simply hold down the designated button for 3 seconds or so.

6) All and all it is a great keyboard. The larger print seems a bit odd at first, but I actually appreciated it in the long run.

Give it about a week of adjustment, as if it were new shoes, and you will not want to go back!

The only things I would complain about are that the ""home"", ""print screen"", and other abbreviations are just confusing and unnecessary. The other complaint is that it always resets back to blue, a switch instead of a button would have resolved this.",Great Keyboard!,1387238400,

The media functions are great, and install without having to download any drivers. Plug and Play is always nice.
The lights are bright, and the option for different colors is very nice and necessary at times.
Also being able to turn the lights completely off is a nice feature.
There is a nice amount of space to rest your wrists also, wasn't expecting the keyboard to be this comfy!
Sometimes keyboards are setup a lil different then i'm used to and i mistype but this keyboard feels perfect to my fingers.
The large print is a nice touch and i think all illuminated keyboards should be like this too.

I would like to mention that the first keyboard I ordered failed to illuminate, but I did a return through amazon and the keyboard that arrived worked perfect. Smooth and easy return transaction, no questions asked.

Only flaw so far is that some of the larger keys rub against surrounding keys and make a lil noise, I will probably take the problem keys off and file them down. This will not deter me from buying another one of these for my office.

I do recommend this keyboard, even if you are not using the lights. You will find the keyboard comfy and the media buttons useful.

Lowrance,"I am a fast touch typist, and for my normal work this keyboard is unusable. The little fingers are the worst! Example: If you press the A key down perfectly straight from above it works fine, but from the touch typing angle it always binds, so to compensate you press harder. The text is then often left without many letters, and you must go back to correct them. This keyboard will get me through for a short time period, until a better one arrives. A good backup one to have around I suppose. Also the noise it makes is very different and I believe much louder then a normal keyboard, a little more pressure is needed to depress the keys and when they bottom out you get a nasty slapping click, particularly typing faster. It would definitely wake up my wife if I were trying to work next to her in the bedroom. Just typing this paragraph, my left little finger is getting fatigued!

The led is awesome, nice big letters that are easy to see in low light (or no light for that matter). Quality construction that isn't going to wear out. If you like to work in low light (no glare on the screen) and want a quality light up led keyboard (with 3 awesome colors) that will last a long time, then this is worth every penny.

I could hold it where the light was better if need be.  It unfortunately had the bad habit of dropping letters, or failing to connect to the dongle/ receiver a few inches away.  Since it had been purchased through the warehouse, I thought it was, perhaps, defective and so returned it and replaced it with a new one same model) and same problems, or worse :(  For months I have been living with a keyboard  which inserts letters, phrases, half sentences in random places, occasionally sending me to a new page.. As others have had positive experiences with that board i tried quite a few things to trouble shoot.  Nothing worked so I came back and bought another keyboard, this time opting for a simple wired keyboard with a simple bold font and back lighting (and the option of 3 colors!)

The Azio keyboard is usb, plug and play (at least on Windows 7, and likely others).  It is full size (actually a bit larger) molded plastic.  It is not lightweight, but not solid either (the back is molded) but it feels substantial enough.  The action is somewhat light (so those looking for a type writer feel may be disappointed) but it is better than lap top keyboards.  I find the shape and small wrist rest work/ feel better than the padded wrist rest I had been using.

It has a handful of preprogrammed hot keys (for media, email).  There is a key (marked with a light bulb) to change colors and turn the backlighting on and off (does anyone read manuals? in this case a 4x6"" quick start guide).

It is a simple usb plug and play keyboard with a large back-lit font that is easy to read, and unlike any other keyboard I have seen, it glows purple (unless you prefer red or blue).  Unless this fails very quickly, i  would turn around and buy another.  I am very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend it.

Well, now I have to deal with returning it. First of all, the box arrived to my house slightly damaged...basically it looked like somebody had definitely opened the box and took the product out at one point. But I figured okay, who cares, let's check it out. Before even plugging it on, I took it out of the box ---and as I did, 3 of the keys simply fell off onto my lap. Now, even at this point, I still had an open mind. The keys easily clicked back in, so I decided to play around a bit and type on it (mind you, before I even plugged it into my computer). As others have said, it feels pretty much exactly like a laptop keyboard. I knew this before I purchased it, but I didn't think it would bother me. Turns out, it did bother me, and the keys just didn't respond the way I like them to. After ALL this, I still decided what the heck, I bought it STRICTLY for the backlight, as I'm sure is the reason a lot of you are even giving it the time of day. So I plug it in, Windows 7 has no problem installing the drivers and getting it working right away. I go to press the backlight key....NOTHING. Turns out, the backlight function at least on the product I received was defective. So now, I simply HAVE to return it (Which I don't make a habit of doing because It's pretty much a hassle). So yes, I'm aware I could have received a defective unit. I personally suspect that this item had already been returned to Amazon, and surprisingly (because I'm a pretty big Amazon fan), they sent me the same one that was returned.

By the way, I write, and the keys keep up for me with no problems.  Essentially, it's those little tasks, like passwords, where finding the right key is important, that this keyboard excells.  I can keep the lights off and still see what I am doing.

I'd highly recommend this for a good general keyboard that has the added benefit of lights.  And it gives my computer desk a very cool look, since my computer lights and keyboard are both now blue!

-Lights are great, easy to see in the dark or dim room.
-Works right out of the box. No install disk necessary, just plug and play (I have a Win 7 computer).
-On/Off button for the 'lights' works fine.
-The 'special keys' like Print Screen, Scroll Lock, Num Lock, and even the ones for Mail, Home, Favorites, Sound volume, calculator, etc. worked fine out of the box (again no install disks necessary).
- The large keys... well I don't really need that feature and IMO I would prefer not to have the large keys, but that's ok by me.

CONS:
- I've only had it for less than a month and already the keys are starting to 'stick'... they just feel rough and I have to bang them pretty hard sometimes. But I guess for the price that's ok to live with,too, for me anyways.

UPDATE:
It's now been only two months since I've had this keyboard and the keys stick so bad now it's almost impossible to type. I am sorry I bought it. It's a shame because it's a nice looking keyboard and everything else about it worked fine...but the main function...typing...is what I need so it is useless if the keys are so hard to press.

They conventional layout is pretty much close to the normal layout. About the only slight difference is the placement of the back-slash key, but that's not a major issue.

I don't get nearly as many errors with this keyboard's layout as I did with the compact keyboard I tried before. It's pretty much like using my other full size keyboard. I won't use anything but a full keyboard, unless it just can't be helped, like building an arcade machine, or a flight simulator where full boards won't fit.

I like the media buttons, one of which calls up the calculator, and is so marked. Oddly, these buttons are a bit tiny, and I do have to use a hand held magnifier to see them, but easy enough to memorize their locations and functions.

The feel of the keys is good. I like the sound they make too. Not too clicky, but you know you've made proper contact when you hear them tapping away as any good keyboard should. Not much for the soft, silent keys. I always got errors with those.

I've only used this keyboard for a few hours, and so far I love it!  I especially like the large keys, but I noticed that some people stated that the keys were REALLY large, when in fact if they're larger than normal, not by much.

It is about an inch thick so it's not exactly slim.

UPDATE:  STAY AWAY FROM THE  ""BETTER CHOICE ONLINE""  RETAILER
READ THE ADDITIONAL UPDATE ADDED AT END OF REVIEW.....

I bought this keyboard through Amazon from Better Choice Online.

I am one unhappy consumer !

Do not purchase from this company !!!

Just recieved this today...

First there is no invoice or paperwork included in the shipping box.

On opening the product box and removing the keyboard I immediately noticed
scratches on the front of the keyboard and around the keys.
It appears someone also tried to buff this so there are buff scratch marks.

This keyboard has obviously been used.

It was well packed and the product box was in great condition and the keyboard
was in plastic.

But this is easily discernable as a used item !

I did plug it in and it does work very well - but now I have to decide if I will go through
all the trouble of returning it and then getting another one shipped....

One thing - I will never purchase anything from Better Choice Online !!!

UPDATE

I CALLED BETTER CHOICE ONLINE AND WAS BASICALLY CALLED A LIAR
THAT WHAT I AM TELLING THEM ABOUT WHAT I RECEIVED IS IMPOSSIBLE.

IT WAS AN UNCOMFORTABLE CONVERSATION.

I ENDED UP HANGING UP ON THEM.

The keyboard part is the problem.  Clearly it is of low quality and most of the keys stick, meaning that when you press them they do not register a press.  If you are not always ensuring that what you press was accepted you will see missing characters.  They also feel like they are sticking most of the time.  Not all keys are affected it seems to be about a third of the keys in various locations.

This is particularly bad for a lighted keyboard as if you think about it the people who need a lighted keyboard are those like myself that do not touch type and tend to look at the keys when they are typing and not at the screen.

In short:

Pros:
Excellent led illumination
-Ability to turn off led lights by holding down led button
-3 led color choices
-Sturdy construction

Cons:
-Keys are difficult to press. If you like keys that are soft to press this is not the keyboard for you. The keys are very stiff and those who type fast will find this to be a significant deal breaker as you will often end up not pressing hard enough to register the keystroke.

-the keyboard keys are extremely loud. When i typed on it the first time those around me immediately complained. The sound has been described as a herd of children stampeding on a bubble wrap floor.

Overall:
If you can live with the cons or don't notice these things it is a well built keyboard otherwise with all the light features of more expensive keyboards and more at a 1/3 the price.

The lighting is definitely bright enough, though I would love to have a dimmer knob like on my old Saitek keyboard.  For those use to the ""taller"" desktop keyboard keys, it may take a bit to familiarize themselves with the more laptop-like keys.  I dig the media controls at the top, though I only ever use the vol up/down/mute ones and kind of wish those were moved over to the right side, above the numpad.

The one thing I don't like (and it's probably minor for a lot of shoppers) is the poor visibility of the media buttons across the top, and specifically (for me) the up-down-mute buttons, because I use them a lot.  The icons for these buttons are very small and difficult to see.  I actually put a smear of White-Out below each of the volume buttons to make them easier to find.  Adding to the frustration is that the volume-up and down buttons are not very sensitive; you kind of have to mash them to make them have an effect.  Sadly, this is a problem with many of the keyboards I've tried.  Regarding everything else about this keyboard though, I'm thrilled.  The large lettering on the keys is great, and shows clearly regardless of the chosen color, and they have a very nice 'clicky' touch which I like (this is very subjective...some like a low-travel key and some like more of an old-fashioned keyboard feel like this one).  It's not noisy but it does make a satisfying (to me) sound as I type. I haven't had any issue with the space bar being positioned too low in relation to other keys as some others have mentioned.  I type 65+ wpm and can type on this keyboard pretty quick. One other thing about the color selection...this keyboard, like a lot of other keyboards with color choices, reverts to blue each time your computer shuts down, so if you care, you have to re-select the red or purple if that is your choice.  Being a complacent kind of guy, I just leave it on blue.",A strong 4-star product,1377734400,

What you will get is a standard keyboard (one that you typically get free when you buy a Dell or HP) that does not have ""silent"" typing. The keyboard makes noise. Live with the click-clack tip-tap or move on. Nothing can be done about it and that is the only reason I rate this a 4 instead of 5.

The keys are standard sized (all correctly spaced and functioning as they should for a windows style keyboard), but the font for each letter/number is large and centered (great for those with eyesight not so perfect) on the keys. The keyboard has 3 colors AND an off setting, which is easily switched via a button on the top right hand side.

The spacebar can be a bit sticky sometimes if it's not pressed in the center, which, you know, is annoying. But it's infrequent enough to be useable (happened there though after the word ""infrequent"", bleh). Annoying, also, is that the keys are inset to be not much higher than the outside frame, which means it's harder to feel your way to certain outside keys - hard to explain, but I prefer my keys to be sticking up so that I can, say, bat at the top-left corner and hit Escape easily.

It's not the randomly placed, leaking backlighting you see on other keyboards that shines in between and up through the keys. It's exactly and ONLY on the lettering on each key. I only ever use the red color, the others are too strong for my taste. I do wish it had a memory setting to keep it on that color, because I have to cycle back to red for every power on. I also like how when I lean back, or back up my chair to watch a movie, the angle of the lighting fades out somewhat. This means that when I'm up close for gaming or working, the letters are brightly lit, but when I want to relax and watch a video, it fades out and I don't notice it.
Also, I cannot understate the awesomeness of the hotbar keys! Without any programming whatsoever, they have integrated with all of my software exactly how I want them to. They control my e-mail client, my videos, volume, calculator, etc.
I wish the keyboard had a bigger, softer wrist rest, but I use a separate one now.
Also, the keys are not ideal for typing, as they sometimes catch on themselves or require too much force to push. But honestly, I just got this for the amazing illumination. Even though the switches and tactile feeling is not perfect, it still works just fine for League of Legends. I mean, unless you're writing a book, or going to be writing daily, I don't think it's an issue. If you are going to do that, get another keyboard.

I love it. All three different color lights ""Red, Blue & Purple"" are nice & bright. I love using this keyboard especially now while watch my projector in the dark because now I can use a keyboard in the dark. Shoot not I can see the key's without straining to see the keys even with light on.

Pros: Back light on Keys are very bright & the key's are all big enough to hold that giant letter. The keys are big bright & in your sight. (Smile :-).
All three colors are nice, but I prefer the blue the most. Every time that I tried to use the red, I felt like a vampire or evil character from a movie should be probably using this color, so I would always switch back to the blue & the purple is alright (Just joking about the red) it looks actually good.  My Mac's & my Windows PC's & Linux boxes all saw it without installing a driver or anything. So the setup was just plug in the USB & then use, that's it. Both shift keys & back space key are regular sized which are a plus nowadays because with these new keyboards they usually shorten the keys & size of keyboard & with this keyboard they did not do that. It feels pretty light in the hands & the build quality seems really good as far as I am concerned, but I am not a picky person.

Cons: It was shipped with the air square packing stuff only on the top inside of the package on top of the keyboard which left the back under side & left & right of the keyboard insecure & with a good drop it would have broke because of the packing, but whom ever delivered it was the hero because it came in excellent condition. Now the person who actually packed it up should not ever be packing any again. The only problem that I had was the enter key when I first got it stuck slightly until I used it enough & now the enter key works as smoothly as the rest of the keys.

I will be purchasing more of these large key keyboards for my self & telling others that I know that have eye problems like me about this wonderful keyboard. Oh & I almost forgot to tell you that the key on the top right is the key that changes the colors of the keyboard, but that very same key is also the on & off switch for this keyboard & to turn it off all you do is hold the key down for around 3 seconds &  then it will cut the light out. If you do not do that, my experience is after you turn off the computer, then the keyboard stays ;lit because all usb is after all is a interface, but with power, so make sure that you turn off the light on this keyboard every time that you turn off the computer or this light will stay on & probably burn out the led's eventually, but not a problem because this very smart company who made this keyboard engineered it with a on & off switch which is rare these days. So yay for the power button :-). Now go get yours.",Excellent Keyboard for people like me with eye problems.,1372550400,

Contents was the actual keyboard itself and a small user guide (keyboard is plug n play as far as windows 8 goes).

The keyboard is great and feels a bit durable the only drawback is when I don't use the LED illumination a few keys are faded (the right arrow and [9(] key). When plugging in this keyboard all the keys lit up including the hotkeys in a nice blue. I believe that I will stick with the blue instead of the red or purple for personal preference, the three colors have the same brightness level and purple is a light purple instead of dark like the other two settings. The lock notifications are a green LEDs that is not surfaced for maximum indication unless you are right about the keyboard itself. When you are not right above the keyboard the glossy cutouts for the LED are reflecting the green light as a green circle and still can be seen in either low or normal lighting.

Some reviews say that the keys stick at times or that the keys lay flat, both of which in my experience are not true. The keys have a slight curve inwards to the lettering like my old PS/2 Keyboard but not as pronounced. This is a membrane switch type keyboard and keys are bound to stick at times but I haven't encountered that yet. This review has been typed by the Azio keyboard on first day use and will be updated if anything has been changed. Overall this is a great keyboard and I am a proud user of it!

Day 2: Lighting and Hotkeys.

The blue and purple lighting have a radiant feel to them when there is no light except from the monitor while the red does not. Due to this I have switched from blue to red for night use and for low light I use blue. During the the day the red looks a bit orange in color while the blue and purple remain the same. I have the LEDs off during the day as the keys can be seen perfectly. For the hotkeys in Windows 8, E-mail and Home just open Google Chrome to my homepage and the Favorites does nothing(Favorites does open a bookmarks drop down in Firefox though). I use the Volume and Calculator hotkeys the most for a quick volume adjust or calculation. Music opens xbox music in Windows 8 and works wonderfully with the Media hotkeys. My least used hotkey is the Computer folder hotkey as I don't usually need to do anything there.

Update: Accident.

A friend spilled some of his drink onto the keyboard and I have to say that cleaning this keyboard is easy. To pop the keys off I used a small metal nail filer which on some keys made a small cosmetic damage that won't interfere with typing. He didn't spill much to drown the keyboard and the LED Illumination still worked whilst still cleaning. I decided to keep the keyboard plugged in to find the droplets a bit faster. Overall doing this was easy and fast and helped me clean some of the dust that had built up inside.

Tip: For anyone planning on removing the keys.

Remember that a few keys have a piece of metal go under the plastic latches on the keyboard. This insures that wherever you press on the key, it will be registered as a keystroke.",Great Keyboard!,1372377600,

My first one I bought was a Firefly Borealis less than a year ago. I loved it for a couple of days. Then it turned out to be a sorry piece of junk. So I swore this time around I would buy a name brand and pay what it was worth. But, while comparing this type of keyboard on Amazon, I saw this Azio, a brand I never heard of. The amount of 5 star ratings and the very low price...I was pretty sure it just MIGHT be okay. Well, it is. Not worth 5 stars, but so far a nice solid 4 are in order.

PROS:
*It is a bargain, and even if you don't like it as much as expected, you are not out very much.

*It actually works very well, and the 3 backlighting colors you can choose from are easy to change. All of the colors look pretty amazing.

*It is better than the standard keyboard that came with my Dell XPS. BUT you still will not mistake either one for a very expensive keyboard. Just that this one is better.

CONS:

*This probably won't do the trick if you do a great deal of typing. I don't, and so far I am happy with it.

*The oversized keys take a bit of getting used to. Once you do get used to them, this keyboard is great to use in low light conditions.

*Even after your computer goes to sleep, this keyboard stays glowing. To turn it off, you must hold down on the same key that allows you to change colors for several seconds.

*It clacks kind of loudly while you type, so the cheapness is apparent. There is no smooth, fluid keyboard action you will find in a high quality (but much more expensive) keyboard. However, It stills works good enough for what I need. If I was ever to write a book, which I probably never will, I would certainly unplug this keyboard and swap it out for my un-backlit, but rock solid Microsoft keyboard that has served me great for years. But for late night hunt and peck typing, I would rather use this one.

Bottom Line:  After a few weeks of use, it is impressive. I could almost go 5 stars, but to be honest, if it did not have backlighting, it would rate 3 stars. About the same as with most standard keyboards just ""thrown in"" with name brand computers you pay hundreds or even a thousand or more for. However, for overall value, it is certainly a 4 star purchase. Recommended.",Worth Taking A Chance On.,1367193600,

I found a single color does not work well under all lighting conditions or @ day vs night. Having the ability to change colors is crucial.

Some others have also complained that the keys seem to be  ""clicky, sticky or too springy. Depending on the type of keyboard you have been using this may also be true but I wouldn't say excessively so and you'll likely quickly adjust to both conditions, as am I.  I do not believe at all that it is an indication of poor quality but of design, in fact, the keyboard is more heavy than my reliable old $60 Logitech multimedia keyboard. Do I LOVE this keyboard ? No, but I do love the price, the large letters and the 3 color feature and it seems to be well built & of good quality for the money which is why I rated it 5 stars.

Original post:
The keyboard works as advertised I guess.  They keys feel hollow and light and have a slight clack to them.  The big print is why I got it and boy does it ever.

Even though the lights don't go off by themselves in sleep mode (or hibernate), they can be turned off by holding the button that changes the color for a few seconds. No biggie.

My biggest gripe really isn't of the keyboard engineering, but Im a gamer and not fond of the flat keys. I realized this might be a problem for me when I ordered it so I cant say it's the keyboard's fault but mine for choosing one of this design because I should have saved up for a month or two and just get a mechanical keyboard with the raised ""standard"" keys.

I like dumping an over-analyzed  pro/con list so here it is.

Pros:
`Illuminated with three colors- I only use red, though, its dimmest of the three colors; red blue, white. The white is nice. Blue is a bit freaky looking imo.
`Cheapest illuminated keyboard I could find- most of the other ones are in the $50+ range, making this ~$20 cheaper. (however, those definitely have more quality, not just more functions)
`Shortcut keys- includes the basic media buttons, volume, shortcuts to calculator etc.
`Includes the standard rubber placement grips and height elevator things on the back of the keyboard.
`has the finger placement guides on 'f' and 'j' keys

Cons:
`Keypad does not show the functions when num lock is disabled.
`numerous of the larger keys get caught when pressing on the corners so it's more or a crunch rather that a smooth key press. For example the top left of the enter key gets caught and the top of shift keys. They work fine if you press right in middle of the key but still a huge con for me.
`the various functional keys are shortened. Example given, page up/down are PU/PD. This could be detrimental to people not yet accustomed to using these keys.

Neutral/miscellaneous notes:
`Big letters- I'm a touch typist so this hardly matters to me. I'm sure it's useful for people with vision problems but it can also be hard to get used to.
`Shiny frame is fingerprint magnet
`Very low resistance keys - I'm more accustomed to keys with more resistance but I'm sure I can adapt eventually. Despite this, it's not oen of those quiet keyboards.
`The indicator lights for num lock, cap lock, scroll lock are too bright for my tastes.
`No brightness control- no big deal
`No macro keys- no prob don't need em
`Cannot reassign shortcut keys at top
`Standard keys that you can pop out in case you get something stuck underneath.
`Someone else mentioned that the keys are about 1/2 height of standard keyboard but I think that's just something else you become used to.
`Doesn't seem to have any key ghosting found on other a few other keyboards such as the logitech slim illuminated, but I only checked the common gaming combo shift+w+space
`You can turn off the lights by holding down the illumination key. They should have included this in the manual but didn't... No need to flip over the keyboard when watching movies in the dark.

My last keyboard was the MS Sidewinder x4 which simply deteriorated over time from heavy use.

I ordered the Azio and it arrived promptly and in good condition despite the poor padding in the manufacturers box. I plugged it in and it lit up right up.

The quality and feel of the keys themselves is at least as good as the unlit Logitech K120 I replaced with the Azio, and better than some other low profile keyboards I have had. The larger, flatter keytops give it a slightly loose feel compared to the Logitech, but overall they are about the same to type on. I do not really like the feel of the dome switch semi-chicklet keys that are pretty much the only thing available in this price range but I have gotten used to it since mechanical keyboards are out of the question with my current budget. I have not noticed the spacebar problem that a few other people have mentioned, but then I had to get used to typing with my thumbs very close to center to avoid that problem on my laptop and this keyboard is much nicer than that one.

In just the time I have had it it has survived a minor spill, something I did not expect and I was pleasantly surprised.

The keys are nice and bright and very easy to see and the color change works well though I usually just leave it blue.  I have no problem seeing the lit media keys either, though the none of the media keys work so far. I have to plug the keyboard into a USB extender because of the poor design of the corner desk I have and the extender is very old (it may be USB1.1) so I am going to try swapping the it for a new one I bought along with the keyboard when I get time to do the stringing to see if that makes a difference. I do not use media keys much anyway since most of the keyboards I have had did not include them so it is not a big thing either way.

I gave it four stars because of the huge difference it makes in seeing the board, I took one away for the feel of the dome style keys and the trivial inconvenience of the media key thing.  Overall I would strongly recommend it for those needing a lit, easy to see keyboard on a budget.

Followup: I upgraded to a new computer running Windows 8 and it recognized all of the special function keys without any problem.

The keys held up well under very heavy use in the close to a year I had it though the tops were starting to show some wear (it was still very legible even on the worst worn key tops though).  I would probably still be using the original one except that my cat chewed the cord which destroyed it (I replaced it with a SteelSeries lit gaming keyboard with keys that are less flat and a much heavier cord).

I would still recommend this keyboard and recently bought one as a gift.  The odd thing is that her system is a Windows 7 like my old one (though hers has an Asus motherboard)and all of the special keys (media,etc)all work well with it.",Very good keyboard for the price,1358380800,

Cheap for a backlit keyboard.
Colors are bright and the keys are clearly visible for my aging parents.
Multi color (red, magenta, and blue)
Looks great!
Great frame, except for a flaw (see below)
Soft touch - not much finger force required

NEGATIVES:
Looks great until you touch it. The keys feel as cheap as ever. The keys are extremely flat with absolutely no contour for your fingers. You can't feel the boundaries of the keys and I often catch my finger slipping into nearby keys. The keys fall below the keyboard's frame. This is not much of an issue until you hit the space bar, which requires a semi angled thumb to depress it. Hitting the spacebar as we typers/gamers normally do often results in no input; the thumb will hit essentially the frame of the keyboard depressing the space bar just slightly but not enough to trigger the input.

I bought this to replace an old Saitek Eclipse II because its keys had faded so much. However, this Azio keyboard can't compete with the feel of the Eclipse II and many other competitors. I went back to my abused Eclipse II until I can find a cheaper replacement but not down to the quality of the Azio. Something in-between would be great. I would return this product but $30 ain't worth the trouble considering how much I would pay to send it back. Maybe someone around here could have a good use for it.",Aesthetics are great but....,1358208000,

I didn't think I'd like the large letters, but I do, and the color change is a plus.  I don't like laptop style keyboards so the full size is a plus for me.  Key action is fine.

Even with the keyboard flat, the space bar is large and high enough to hit comfortably with my wrists right on the table. With the back feet down its an even better angle.  I'm not sure what other reviewers are talking about.

I love using a single keystroke to open a calculator, internet, email, volume control, my computer, etc, so its great to have so many of those shortcut keys in the top row. The icons on these buttons are a too small.  If I squint I can make them out and I have 20/20 eyesight.  Someone who NEEDS large number wouldn't be able to make them out at all. The buttons are narrow but maybe they could have labels on the frame above, like the num lock label.

The back light goes off when I turn off my computer and on when I turn it on.  The quick start instructions tell you how to turn the back light on and off during use as well as change colors.  With back light off, the contrast between grey letters and black keys is not great, some people may need to leave the back light on all the time.","Even with a few faults, I love this keyboard!!",1358208000,

I do like the layout, feel and quality of the keyboard but my 20/50 macular degeneration vision makes my normal Logitech white on black normal sized lettering much easier to use than this ""novelty"" keyboard.

1. The backlighting will not work if you plug this keyboard into a USB hub, even a powered one, so make sure you can spare a USB port on your computer for the keyboard. And, if you can't activate the backlighting, you won't be able to see the letters on the keys at all. They will be very faint.

2. The pitch between the keys is closer than on a standard keyboard. I rather like it because I have small hands.

3. The icons on the small keys in the topmost row which control email, multimedia, etc. are so small as to be indecipherable, especially if the keyboard is sitting flat. I never use these keys anyway, so I don't care about that. And, when the keyboard is flat, the function keys in the second row from the top appear much fainter than the rest of the keys. If you flip the little feet down under the back of the keyboard so it sits on a slant, the function keys are easier to see. The topmost row, however, remains nearly invisible.

I think it's strange that this keyboard has oversized letters on the keys, which feature is normally targeted to people with vision problems, yet has these extremely tiny icons on the media row. Anyway, the letters are large and very easy to see, if that's what you're after, and I was. Still, I think this keyboard is best suited to teenagers with perfect vision, who like to use their computers in the dark. It's much easier to see the keys when most of the lights are out. Obviously this isn't a keyboard for a brightly lit office, but then they don't market it that way.

The letters are huge, this is the main reason for my purchase of this item. However, there are some cons. The keyboard is surrounded by an extra plastic piece, both on the top and the bottom of the keyboard. I find it very difficult to use ""thumb keys"" such as the space bar, etc. The space bar is level with the plastic piece so you actually have to lift up your thumb to use the bottom key functions. I inspected the plastic surround piece and there is no way (that I see) to remove it. It that were possible, I would give this a much igher rating.
 The keys themselves have a good responsive feel to them. They do make a click sound when using them, but that is what a keyboad does, no big deal there. The lighted feature is fantastic! I used the keyboard in the dark and it is totally cool! I found the blue color is most visible to me. The purple was a bit harsh, but everyone will have their own opinion about the color. Yes, the light can be turned off by pressing and holding the illiumination key.  Also, the keyboard is wider than the normal keyboard that comes with standard computers. It takes up more desk space.
 If anyone knows or has suggestions on how to remove the plastic surround, please let me know.

This is a follow up after using the keyboard for a couple of weeks:

I have decided to return this keyboard. Some of the keys have started to stick. The enter key being the worst. Unless you hit the direct center of the key, it will catch. I have also found that the height of the keys and the plastic surround had become very bothersome. The keys are almost flat even with each other and this had made typing difficult.

Set up is easy peasy, plug n play....did you know you can have two keyboards working at the same time? I can keep my wireless board hooked up for daytime use & the Azio lighted for night, sweeeet.
Quality seems pretty tight....no ugly suprises, everything works as expected.
The Keys are a bit bigger & the lettering is very big :) about twice normal size. And I like this, & it was easy to adjust to. The keys feel pretty good in use, a tad less cushy spring resistance than higher end units, yet within the comfort zone. The change in the key size does increase the probability of keystroke error....& some adjustment in technique is required.
The lighted keys are perfect, just what i was looking for, easy to see, & not so bright as to be a distraction.
It is nice to have options in the colors, & this is one of the few boards that boasts this feature.
All in all i think this is a very good product & i enjoy using it, no more squinting in the dark for me :)
The price point was the deciding factor, as there are a few other boards that are obviously better, but they cost twice as much & more.

I bought 2 of these, and I'm really impressed!  I've attached 3 pics showing the brightness of the color in a dark room.  The color intensity seems just right, and the letters are very easy to read.

Pros:
+ Solid build quality.
+ 3 colors & and an off mode (hold color-button for 3 seconds).
+ Keys are responsive, they sound & feel good too!
+ It's designed well, and I'm willing to bet that it'll last a really long time!
+ Very affordable considering all the features it has.
+ I'm a PC-gamer, and I approve this keyboard!
+ I think this keyboard is so neat, that I'd be willing to give it as a gift - to anyone!

Cons:
- No ""white"" color (not a big deal).
- Holding down the color-button to turn off the colors takes ""2 seconds"" too long: it should turn off after being held for just 1 second.

2) the colors are awesome, surprisingly the pink color is very eye catching.
3) It is a quiet typer, not much clickety-clack keeping people up at night. Some people might like clickety clacking though so it is just a personal preference to be aware of.
4) great price, cheaper and easier than hacking my logitech keyboard with a brighter DIY led upgrade. (I looked online and it didn't look easy at all)
5) not much bleed through of the light / back lighting in between the keys, making it look very nice and clean. look at the other competing back-lit keyboards. you can see a massive amount of bleed around the backside of the keys, turning it into a visual mess!

CONS:

1) the space bar is nearly flush with the wrist mount so you might have a harder time reaching it depending on your typing style.
2) people have mentioned how annoyingly small the del button is. if you use DEL a lot that might be an issue.
3) I don't like the feel of the key travel (they are listed on their site as a membrane switch) but that is just a personal preference.
4) the keys are flat and smooth, not contoured or cylindrical so if you are used to that feel of a raised edge to help typing then this will leave something to be desired.
5) Cruddy manual. not that you need one but I did and it didn't mention turning off the key lighting at all, hence the video
6) I'm not familiar with the reputation of this company but at this price who cares.
7) No dedicated calculator button and it is light on  other media buttons. I guess you could customize/remap them with software like autohotkey.
8) no USB pass through hub - but one wasn't advertised. If you want one just buy one. This one is my favorite:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Satechi-12-Port-USB-Hub-with-Power-Adapter-2-Control-Switches/dp/B0051PGX2I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Satechi 12 Port USB Hub with Power Adapter & 2 Control Switches</a>

It functioned, but it was bad... read on:

After a poor review of the first keyboard I received, ChallengerUSA contacted me to get the board replaced.  Now that I have the new one, my first review is no longer accurate.

I had three (plus one) requirements of a keyboard, and this met all of them.

1)  Backlit.  Back lighting is great for this keyboard

2)  Low-profile.  Love low-profile/chiclet-style keyboards, but they don't seem to be super popular.

3)  Media controls.  As with backlighting, media controls are great, really just essential for any gaming keyboard.

The ""plus one"" requirement is that the keyboard MUST type well!  I thought that was tacit since a keyboard's sole design should revolve around a pleasant typing experience.  Anyway, the first keyboard I received had keys that liked to stick, either up or down.  I think the keys were poorly fitted to the board, because many took highly varying degrees of force to press, and sometimes they would get stuck down (like thissssssssss). Or they would be super difficult to press so ou nd up tping lie this.  As you can imagine, it was extremely frustrating.

I have since exchanged that keyboard for a replacement, and I have to say that the first one I got was just a bad one.  The first board I received felt very much like textured plastic, to the point that it was almost sticky (in an adhesive, gummy sort of way).  I think this was part of the issue in the keys getting hung up in the up or down position.  The replacement I'm using now still has a coarse texture, but it is more like a granite or rough-stone texture.  Obviously I can still tell that it's plastic, but it feels like this batch of polymer cured a little better than the previous.  The first keyboard was like undercooked cookies, this keyboard is like overcooked cookies... or something...  Regardless, the keys don't stick - a HUGE plus.

It's a great keyboard for the price. If you have problems like the ones I described, don't hesitate to contact ChallengerUSA.  They sent me a return label and took back my old keyboard even without the box.  I sent the old keyboard back Monday and got the replacement Friday, so awesome turnaround to boot.  Good folks.

Back to the keyboard:  I like low-profile keys a la the Dell XPS L502x laptop, and this looked to be the closest I could find for a desktop.  The keys have a lighter feedback than scissor-style switches; they really just feel like they're using the force of the rubber dome beneath to stay up.  Take from that what you will; if you like a light tactile feedback, these are great.  If you want something heavier, maybe look for scissor style switches or get away from chiclet keyboards altogether.

While it would be great if they put just a little more engineering into the key feedback, e.g. scissor-style switches, I can't really complain because the light tactile feel works for me too.

I would love to go with 5 stars, but I don't seem to be alone in receiving less-than-optimal keyboards, which leads me to believe Karura could stand to work on their quality control a little bit.

If you get a properly manufactured keyboard, it's a solid 5 stars for the price. If you have to suffer through a bad one first, I think you'll feel me when I only give it 4 stars.","Updated review! Lots of cool features, great price, poor quality control?",1409443200,

Also, the fact that the music control keys require holding down the FN key is a step down from my other keyboard.

I bought this keyboard as a silent alternative to my mechanical board, but overall I have been unimpressed by the way it feels and by the key layout (giant enter key -- I am a programmer and use backslash enough that this was obnoxious).

I like the variable backlight colors and it actually feels sturdy with minimal flex which was a pleasant surprise for a keyboard at this price! I can use it on my lap when gaming out in the living room and works quite well for first person shooters. Braided cable is a nice touch. Awesome.  However!! ...there's always a catch, isn't there.

The keys are stiff - it takes considerable more pressure to actuate the keys than what I'm used to.  Now that's something you can eventually adapt to - the problem is, some keys, especially the horizontally longer keys to the right of the keyboard, such as the 'backspace', need more pressure than others, especially if you press the key off-angle and not right in the center (perhaps a little bit of binding is at play).  So while touch typing, this can be aggravating when a key press didn't register because you didn't press it hard enough despite using the same pressure as the other keys.

So in conclusion, great for FPS gaming (where your hand is over the WASD, shift and spacebar) but not so much when you're typing away.  I still think it's an overall decent value given the low price, but it could be a 5 star product if it weren't for that inconsistency. I've noticed other reviews have noted similar issues so just add me to that list.

Update: The backspace started to become more and more problematic with its binding, sometimes not working even after pressing it again, harder!  Returning this to Amazon and lowering it to 2 stars vs 3.","Affordable, solid, nice look & feel keyboard, but inconsistently stiff keys",1524096000,

The space bar has started to stick and this is driving me crazy. It isn't because of food or drink either as the keyboard has barely been used as I mostly use a wireless one with my tv. This keyboard I use in front of my monitor and the monitor is rarely used. Maybe the space bar is sticking because of the warping? The warping seems to be worse. The return window has passed and I am very disappointed. Lesson learned.

I like it... and like the ability to change colors. Also, the keys are low profile and very quiet. Nothing bothers me more than a clicky and noisy keyboard.

The only issue is that the keyboard is slightly warped so the front left corner floats off of my desk a little. I have tried the keyboard in another area and confirmed it is this keyboard that Ian slightly twisted. I was hoping it would straighten out with use but have had no such luck. With out this issue...

It was recommended to me by Amazon's algo when I searched for a replacement for my Razer keyboard, which I like a lot.
This one has super smooth and VERY quiet keys (love that!), very low travel ( I love it, others hate that), and the back-lighting is surprisingly good (and yes you CAN change the colors, there's a button for that on the right).
The Return key is placed in a slightly different area than on the Razer so I tend to hit the forward slash button a lot, which is annoying but just takes some getting-used to.
The back-lighting is not super even, and I didn't expect that on a keyboard that's so cheap. But it's more than acceptable and chances are you won't notice.

1) Sometimes the keyboard will register a single press as a double press of a key. This hasn't bothered me in gaming, but has become a minor pain when typing. Nothing serious to me, since I don't use this keyboard for anything super important (no office use here).

2) The red LED light is a little too dim. I wish it were a little brighter so that it better matched my overall theme. I have a gaming mouse from Redragon that is also red, and the LED light is much brighter.

I bought this keyboard to go along with my new custom gaming PC, and I think it will do an amazing job. I'm used to a Toshiba laptop keyboard, so the keys feel just fine to me. I read other reviews before purchasing, and will address some of the complaints I saw. Firstly, the space bar. Other reviews said the space bar was significantly harder to press compared to the other keys. I completely disagree. The space bar is just as easy to press as any of the other keys, but it must be noted that, at least with my keyboard, there is a slight spring sound after releasing the space bar, but that won't be noticeable at all when gaming. Secondly, the complaint that the keyboards build material easily picks up skin oils. To me, that claim is completely false. Lastly, and most importantly, the back lighting:

Cons:
-Some keys aren't lit as well as others, namely on the following keys:
  -Space bar
  -Backspace
  -F key
  -0 on the number pad
-The white setting seems to be less bright compared to the other colors
-Space bar noise (this is just being very picky, it's a 24$ keyboard after all)

Pros:
-Back lighting
-7 different color settings (green and cyan are particularly great in my opinion)
-Very smooth key strokes
-Great build material, doesn't feel cheap
-Fantastic braided black and red cable, with plenty of length

Neutral (up to reader):
-Num, Caps, and Win Lock LEDs are not changeable (solid red)
-Redragon logo at bottom center is the brightest/most well lit area of the keyboard

Edit:
After using the keyboard for a week, I now realize the keyboard does accumulate skin oils, but this is nothing a few seconds with a microfiber cloth won't fix",Amazing Budget Gaming Keyboard,1500163200,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81CPRbyA1rL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61Lyy9xmEEL._SY88.jpg']"

This Keyboard works perfectly with Xubuntu 16.10 probably because no Software is required -- all the controlling is done via the Keyboard itself. It's an almost perfect Keyboard.

If I had to complain about a feature it would be the Arm Rest -- it isn't removable. As unfortunate this may be for some people like myself, it's an easy enough oddity to work around. There are 8 colors you can cycle through (including off) and you can have it auto-cycle through them, or, 'breathing' as it's called. If they made the same Keyboard with a removable Arm Rest, I would purchase it and give this one to a friend or family member.

It kind of feels like a Laptop Keyboard with it's smooth feel and almost flat Keys. The Keys have some push-back to let you know that you are actually pressing a key. In pressing the very edge of a key it doesn't get 'stuck' like some of these flat key Keyboards. It looks like quality and it feels like quality.

The USB cable should be long enough for most people and it's covered in a fabric. I bought this with a ""Redragon Centrophorus"" Mouse from the same company, which is also quality. I don't know about longevity, time will tell. Many features are, as of yet, undiscovered by me and quite possible will never be used by me.

I put it back in the box almost as soon as I took it out and gave it a test drive.

Pros:

It is backlit ; different colors ; chiclet style that were just like my laptop that i used for years.

Cons:

the keys were VERY HARD to press down , and when pressed at the edges, they would not depress correctly and fought being pressed down. You had to be directly in the center to push it; one of the F1-12 keys at the top got stuck when i pushed it....only way to get it unstuck was to pull a corner of the key outwards so it would come undone ; the space bar super stiff, as were all the keys, but this one especially; the long wrist rest is nice BUT its very solid and has a plastic feel to it, you might feel some slight unease since its just ""there"" because if you prefer the soft type of wrist rests or something thats softer, this board won't do you any good ; the sturdiness of the board isn't anything to boast about, no flex, but also doesnt look like it would withstand harsh punishment eg food and drink spilled on it ; some slight oil buildup on the keys may happen beacuse of its texture.

The keys compared to the deathstalker are odd, but I can't complain because while off, they are actually quit nice. They are more rubbery feeling and would easily relate to being like a $300-ish laptop keyboard. The keyboard itself is sturdy and stays in place no matter what. I did some hit tests on it and it would barely slide an inch. The LED's are OKAY. The LED's on the keys are not as bright as they are in the picture, however the dragon logo on the bottom lights much brighter than all the keys even on the highest setting. The braided cable is amazing! For such a low price including a braided cable with red and black detail AND a GOLD plated usb end is just pure greatness.

Local LED control is awesome! (High end RGB keyboard manufactures PAY ATTENTION!)
Cheap
Large
Good wrist rest

Cons:
Rubberized, meh.
Some keys squeak, errr.
Enter key is way to narrow, '/' will be the new enter key for you typists.

I don't hate it, let's just put it out there. For a $25 keyboard it's pretty good. It functions just fine, no problems with ghosting or key failures. HOWEVER, the left shift and space bar have this annoying squeak. I know, first world problems. Where all the other keys have a subtle click sound, it's kind of a bugger. I don't know how I feel about the rubberized coating either. Thought I'd like it but now that I'm using it, meh. The one thing, of all things that this keyboard has that I do not prefer is the narrow 'Enter' key. Most keyboard have a longer, horizontally stretched Enter key but this one is more vertical as you can see from the pictures. I would understand for gamer's that this isn't a big deal but for someone that actually uses there keyboard for typing documents every now and then, it's annoying. You have to always remember to stretch your right pinky further over then usual to reach it or you'll end up hitting the slash button... ALL THE TIME! But again, for $25 what can you say.

What I like. The Local LED control is awesome! high end RGB keyboard manufactures need to listen. It's not that hard to have basic RGB control on the keyboard without installing some space/process hogging software just to modify colors not to mention how buggy they can be. Simple hard keys dedicated to LED color adjustments is all you really need. No one in the real world will be typing with their keyboard LED's gyrating 2.6 million colors. Other than that, the wrist rest is decent, though I wish it was sloped down a bit more and not flat. Braided cable is sharp and though he keys feel a bit numb when typing, they are fairly solid.

In conclusion, if key feel isn't too important to you and you want a good RGB keyboard, this is a pretty damn good price.","For $25, don't expect a beast. Though it's still a contender.",1478217600,

- Supergreat price
- The green LED is superb, v v ince
- Keys are essentially silent, would recommend for ninjas
- All keys function, including media/F keys
- There's a dragon on it that lights up how cool is that?? Answer: SUPREMELY
- Cord is braided, allowing for neat look and texture, as well as friction-free movement across wood, corners of desk, etc. [now if only my Anker ergonomic mouse was the same way]
- THERE'S A GOT-DANG CALCULATOR BUTTON, WHO THOUGHT OF THAT?? TAKE THAT, STATS HOMEWORK!

Meh:
- Enter key takes a bit to get used to
- Typing in general is a bit odd because rubber keys, but ya get used to it
- Spacebar doesn't always feel like it's being keyed
- 'Off' is one of the brightness levels, though the highest level is perfect imo
- Caps/Num/Win Lock lights are red and can't be modified in any way - in a way that's kindof a plus though, since you can see what's locked and what isn't without having to actual look at that sector of the keyboard. So I guess this line is superfluous

Cons:
- Spacebar and Backspace keys aren't fully lit [see pics]
- Would return for a hassle-free replacement, but then I'd be without a keyboard for several days :|","Is p neat, except for the spacebar and backspace LEDs",1477612800,"['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71SQcMaYQYL._SY88.jpg', 'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71fq6MoltXL._SY88.jpg']"

This makes me wonder why keyboards from other brands that there to go above $100 some times come with standard usb connections. The keyboard is very silent and I like the fact that the windows key was moved to the right side of space bar. I don't really care much about the led colors but it's a nice touch.

However, the keyboard falls a bit short on the quality of the keys. When I got the keyboard out of the box, the h key would get stuck after pressing it. The F8 and the number pad enter key had a time when they would do that too. It stopped doing it now but it was weird that  The spacebar is a bit flimsy and will not register keystrokes if you don't hit it exactly in the two points where it connects with the rest of the keyboard. I would have to go back and place spaces where it did not register. The keyboard stopped doing this but I think I got used to it. So if you have to get used to the keyboard, then it is no so well designed.

So if I'm not careful, it will get caught and hold down the H key.

This keyboard has more backlight color options (I know that isn't important, but it's nice to pick your own color). And though some have said that since the existing accent color is red, it looks strange if you go with a different backlight, I disagree.

As someone who owns a Death stalker keyboard, I have to say this is almost indistinguishable when using it. Both have the chocolate style keys, which I personally find appealing. They're very responsive, without the excessive click! IMG and noise of the mechanical keyboards. I know those are considered to be tops in the gaming world, but there's definitely an element of personal preference there.

The anit-ghosting seems to work fine on this. I'm able to pay FPS as well as other online games that require simultaneous key presses. Using it on League of Legends, for example, with no trouble or dropped key presses at all. nd in that game it's extremely important to hit your combos correctly.

It's going to take me a while before I get used to typing on this keyboard.
Good key functions, very simple.

The warranty website does not work. The linked website is [...] But when you go to the site, itdoes notwork.

Also, thespacebar does not work like how I would like it to. maybe it will also take some getting used to. I feel it would be better if it were raised a slight bit so that it is easier to push.

EDIT:
Two days after owning this keyboard, I can say that I amdissatisfied. I do not enjoy typing on it. It is very quiet, but feels awkward. The spacebar squeaks when psushed, the space bar often misses spaces (I am a touch typist), and it collects fingerprints very easily. The CAPS LOCK and NUMLOCK and WINLOCK in the top right are far too bright compared to the rest ofthe backlighting. The back lighting also seems to be uneven on the keys, and some of the letters are brighter than others. I will exchangethis keyboard for one of higher quality.

Romero,"Pros- As a gaming keyboard it is sleek, silent and subtle. Sleek, in that it is only 0.7"" high, with a length of around 17"" and a 8"" depth, and while typing your  hands almost glide over the keyboard because of the material it is made of. The 4 settings for your LED lights are as so. OFF, low, Medium, High. There are 7 color options along with an off mode. (which I like if i'm not using my keyboard, i.e. gaming controller.) If you are looking for a color scheme to match your setup at home. all the keys and the Reddragon logo are led lights. The red bad separating the keys and the wrist pad is a constant red. The keys are very quiet when typing, and the entire feel of the keyboard is nice and subtle, not too many buttons or extra gadgets. Just what you need to game.
Cons- as far as typing goes, if you are using it for a keyboard to type an essay on or write a business report, I would look else where. The keys aren't like a standard keyboard in that they do not protrude as far out. I'm noticing now how much trouble i'm having typing. It's skips keys if you don't press hard. and every once in a while it skips shift and space-bar.

Think about it, how hard is typing if you cannot space your words.

The only other pro I can think of is that they gave me a full refund.

Cons: The spacebar is unusable. When pressing the spacebar, I encountered a great deal of resistance, and it rarely detected key presses. Upon removing the spacebar I noticed the reason: The spacebar is activated by a single switch in the center of the keyunpractical for gaming, typing, or any other use. It is assisted by fragile springs which barely help, if at all. When playing Fallout 3 with the keyboard, although I barely used the spacebar during gameplay, whenever I did need to it almost always took 2 or 3 presses to get it to work.

Serous Deficiencies:
The finish is incredibly weak, the coating on the space bar started to erode after 5 hours of intermittent use.
The buttons are extremely soft and mushy, except for the space bar which requires double the pressure to activate.
Just all around poor quality control, the aluminum stripe that runs horizontally in between the keyboard and the palm rest is warped.

Nitpicking:
On larger buttons such as the backspace or shift, the led is placed in a way that leaves the ends of the words not illuminated.

I have no issues whatsoever with the Space Bar key, as others have... Just press the key towards the middle, not on the edges (there's no actuator there)... The keys are very quiet, and I love the low profile of the keyboard... The texture is absolutely amazing; I love the smooth, rubberized finish... Note that the red strip on the bottom has a plastic cover when shipped. You need to remove that for it to look right. Adjusting the Speed of the breathing affect could be a little more precise; it seems there's a big jump between the medium and medium-high settings... but anyway, I seriously love this keyboard. I would just say to be careful with the risers on the back. I accidentally broke one of mine when picking my keyboard up; even though I barely touched it. I would say the two flip-out risers on the back are the worst part of the keyboard, but that's an easy MacGuyver fix.
-------------------------
EDIT:
Its been almost a year, and I now use this keyboard at work, as I love how quiet the keys are. I work for a tech support company where I type all day, every day.

The second riser in the back broke about a week after the first one did. I was still using it, while I would put a sticky notepad under the other side, so that it was even, but it didn't matter. The quality of the riser is just crap, and they should be ashamed for putting something like that on a keyboard like this. It really brought down the value and over quality.

The lighting effects are still very good, and none of the keys show any sign of degradation. Little bits of dust and crumbs, etc, will get stuck in the bezel around the dragon emblem. Due to the very low resistance/feedback of the keys, I found myself making quite a bit of typing mistakes, as sometimes one or two keys just wouldn't register while I was typing. Honestly, this was not the best gaming keyboard, as it really doesn't seem to have all that many gaming features.

I have since bought this keyboard for gaming (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pictek-104-Keys-Anti-ghosting-Mechanical-Gaming-Keyboard-Backlit-Gaming-Keyboards-Computer-Keyboard-with-Blue-Switch-Water-Resistant-for-Gamers/dp/B01DD2SMKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pictek 104 Keys Anti-ghosting Mechanical Gaming Keyboard, Backlit Gaming Keyboards Computer Keyboard with Blue Switch, Water-Resistant for Gamers</a>) and am about 500,000 times happier with it, although the Karura still works well after all this time.","Decent for Price, But There are Better Gaming Keyboards / Good Longevity",1440892800,

I have used keyboards like Razer and Corsair,
and I can definitely tell that this keyboard is up on par with other great keyboards available in the market.

PROS
1) Backlighting is awesome. It has 7 distinctive colours, and all of them are wonderful. Breathe effect is a plus. There are 4 levels of
illumination (off, low, medium, high). If you turned the breathing effect on, it will circle through all seven colours. Simply fantastic.
2) High quality build. This is THE BEST gaming keyboard available under 70 usd range. It has a solid and rigid build, with rubber-like
texture. Looks elite and professional.
3) Good design. It is simple yet very elegant. The overall appearance of the keyboard is very stylish.
4) Wrist rest is wide and comfortable. The rubber-like finish makes it very comfortable to rest your wrist while typing or gaming. Of course,
it will leave a stain if you use it for a while, but after five minutes, the stain will disappear thanks to the materials used to build this keyboard.
5) Typing experience: The keys feels amazing and typing is extremely smooth. It is rather silent when typed on. Keys are incredibly responsive.
6) Gaming experience: Marvelous. Gaming is exemplary for this keyboard.

CONS:
1) Keys spring resistance are rather strong, making it slightly harder to know whether you typed successfully or not.
2) Springy sound of the spacebar. It is not really a bad touch, it is just different. I personally love the sound.

FINAL VERDICT:
An exemplary gaming keyboard from Redragon. It is my first time using their product, but I would like to express my thanks and appreciation
to Redragon for producing such a fine piece of technology. I love it very, very much. :D

I will be looking forward for the next excellence by Redragon. Keep up the awesome work guys. :)",Redragon Karura: Amazing and Exemplary.,1427846400,

Long story short, nope. My keyboard was  defective right out of the box, too.

I decided to risk it going by the lovely colors of the backlighting. And they really ARE lovely - IF you can get them to stay on!

My keyboard installed with no problem (of course, since the basic pre-installed Windows drivers are all you really need). The problems made themselves evident, however, from the first time I tried scrolling through the colors to see what each looked like. The red (which is the first color on the scheme), green, and blue worked fine, but every time I tried to change to yellow, cyan, pink, or white, the keyboard would shut off for a few seconds (fully disconnecting from my system), then finally restart, right back at red (not one of my favorite colors here).

Trying to figure out how to call ChallengerUSA for replacement was an exercise in frustration, so your best bet is probably to go ahead and write a review here (although after I finally gave up and just reluctantly sent an email on their bare bones site, I did get a response the very next day). They emailed me a prepaid return label, and my mail carrier picked the parcel up, which was six days ago. Since then, I've heard nothing more back from ChallengerUSA, and have yet to receive my replacement keyboard. At this point, I'm just hoping to receive my replacement keyboard some time  before the holidays are officially here, and a working one at that, but I'm just not holding my breath.

The reviews declaring quality control issues are all completely accurate. A product is only as  good as its functionality, and this one needs a serious overhaul in the quality control department. Yet another ""made in China"" item that feels like it's just Dollar Store value. So disappointed. Just as a P.S. - I got mine when the price was a penny less than a twenty note. Even THAT ended up proving to be too much to pay... The $36 price tag they're set at right now (12/15/14) is ridiculous, considering the quality control track record here.

*UPDATE*

So, here I sit, second keyboard in front of me, with the EXACT SAME PROBLEMS that I experienced with the first: attempting to set any color beyond the initial 3 causes the keyboard to reboot itself, shutting off, sitting completely unlit and unpowered for about 12 seconds, then restarting on red. Trying to set any color beyond red or the ""breathing"" effect of scrolling through each color is an exercise in futility. And it's not my system. I did a full driver check, purge, and update about two weeks ago (which took painstaking HOURS of time), deleting every single old and possibly corrupted driver in my Device Manager for any device that I had previously installed and subsequently uninstalled, then using multiple methods to update and double-check each remaining driver on my system. Everything is up to date, so the fault here lies solely with this keyboard, and the lack of quality control for it. And this is after I asked, MULTIPLE TIMES, that agents in ChallengerUSA's Quality Control/Tech Support/Customer Service department thoroughly check my replacement for full functionality. I guess asking four times isn't enough.

The colors here, again, are great, IF you can get them to stay on, but at 0 for 2 on keyboards that SHOULD work, but don't, I won't be buying anything sold by ChallengerUSA ever again. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me...

*FURTHER UPDATE*

I feel like I'm being given the runaround from CS here, being told that they're going to check with tech support for a workaround. A Windows 7 compatible keyboard either works on a Windows 7 system, or it doesn't. My system is Windows 7 x64 SP1, with the latest Windows Update, installed just this evening right before connecting the new (still defective) keyboard, and I'm STILL having the EXACT same problems. Getting nothing but the runaround at this point has pushed me to just give up on this and ChallengerUSA, and just go ahead and order an&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Azio-PRISM-USB-Keyboard-with-7-Colorful-Backlights-KB507/dp/B00I9V8D92/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Azio PRISM USB Keyboard with 7 Colorful Backlights (KB507)</a>. Since new egg has them for twenty five bucks right now, that's just a few dollars more than this nightmare of non-functionality has cost me (not including the expense of my sanity).

Save yourself some frustration, and just say no. It's not worth the headaches.

*FINAL UPDATE*

The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Azio-PRISM-USB-Keyboard-with-7-Colorful-Backlights-KB507/dp/B00I9V8D92/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Azio PRISM USB Keyboard with 7 Colorful Backlights (KB507)</a>&nbsp;is working just fine on my system since I received and installed it this evening. Drivers installed perfectly, all 7 colors and multicolor setting come up just fine. I have not experienced any of the issues I dealt with with the Redragon Karura K502.

So, yeah, again - my system wasn't the problem (as I suspected all along). It's the defective keyboards sent out by Redragon that caused my system to experience problems with it.

Until ChallengerUSA does an obvious and decisive overhaul of their Quality Control department, again, I won't be buying anything else from them.","Beautiful colors, IF you receive a working keyboard (I didn't - TWICE)!!!",1418342400,

But first lets see what are the Pros and Cons comparing it to a regular 5-10 dollars keyboard:

Pros:

- Plug and play, you just have to plug it in, no need to go to Redragon's website to get some drivers or anything.
- LED backlight, easy to change color with a press of a key in the keyboard itself

Cons:

- No Windows Key on the left side of the keyboard. If you already are familiar with using that key on Linux or Windows 8 you will feel like there is something missing.
- every single key has like 2 different ""feels"" or ""feedback"" to the press. They feel ""weird"" at first. But then you get some feeling that the key is getting stuck or something and not even working. If you do type really fast you will find yourself frustrated by it. Specially when pressing the SPACE BAR. So. Freaking. Annoying.

It is not worth the money. No wonder it is not available on Redragon's official website.

Oh, and also, when I plugged it in, somehow messed up my AMD's graphics driver. Crashing my Battlefield 4 or any other game after a minute of gameplay. Freezing my PC completely.

I was so frustrated with that issue that I updated my BIOS and changed my GPU drivers and that finally got it working.

Another friend of mine told me that from the various different colors his keyboard can only light up in 3 out of the 7. It just doesnt want to show the others from out of nowhere.

Honestly, and i'm not hating, I love the design and the texture they  used on the keys and keyboard itself, but at the end of the day I would trade design and backlit for a good typing experience.","Got me wishing to have a time machine, to get my money back...",1415059200,

Update
I was misled with the light when I left the first review but after using the keyboard and finding out it is total waste of money,  I must say I was wrong. I have never experienced such keyboard, the keys are hard to press and they get stuck when you press them. I play games occasionally and had a hard time with the keys getting stuck unless I push them again to make them bounce back.

After my initial review, I was contacted by ChallengerUSA to remedy my issues. And they have, their customer service is top notch. They do care about the people buying their products. Now,on to the review of the keyboard they sent me. There are some improvements. They grippy texture is now gone from the keys making speed typing much easier. The space bar issue seems more manageable than before. Same overall layout of they original keyboard, except now the backspace key actually says backspace. They keys seem a lot easier to press, as if the keyboard was pre broken in before I got it. Over all, I'm a lot happier this time around.

Now for a downside, Half of they keys you can see the LEDs illuminating from under them. May not be a problem for some, but with my OCD, having half my keyboard like that and the other half not will bother me, but this is something I can live with. This updated review was typed using the new keyboard without having to smash the space bar multiple times to operate as it should. Previous review was typed up with the original keyboard. Over all, if you're looking for a cheap keyboard to buy that lights up and has some good features,this isn't a bad purchase at all. If you have any problems with it, contact the seller. They will do what they can to insure you're happy.

Leaving previous review up for anyone who cares to read it.

You get what you pay for, so cant expect some excellent keyboard. For the price its not bad. Rather hard to type on as keys feel tough. The space bar sometimes requires multiple strikes to register. The keys have a grippy feel to them, so may have to adjust how you type. Some of the LEDs are brighter than others on some of the keys. Altogether, if you're on a budget its a nice keyboard. Maybe Im one of the unlucky few with the space bar and tough keys (a few reviews pointed to this) but overall its not a bad purchase.","Not bad, but not excellent, but is getting better",1412899200,

Pros:

- Cheapest backlit keyboard that isn't trash.
- It's not glossy, it's not matte, it's GRAINY. It has a lot of traction, and I can feel my hands move over the keys very easily, even on my two fingers that have nerve damage, which is super cool.
- Did a bend test, really didn't bend much.

Worth noting for some:

- Keyboard makes a very unique sound when typing. Certainly not mechanical loud, but it's louder than my other keyboards (those are scissor-switch though)
- It pushes back a lot before it actuates. I know some would love this though, so despite my not liking it, I think it's just worth noting.

Cons:

- This space bar! Geeze. It's ten times harder to press than the other keys! I feel like on all the other keys I type, but I need to really punch that spacebar to get to do anything. It also makes a weird springy metal sound when pressed, that none of the other keys make.
- The lights on the upper-right, as well as the bottom are way brighter than the other backlit keys. The top right one always stays red. Doesn't look as cool.

Conclusion: I still suggest people get the Logitech K740 if they want backlit, even though it's just white. It types perfectly. Scissor-switch. Near-silent. Very pretty.

But if someone tells me they won't go over the price of $40, this is what I will suggest. (I got it for $26, but it's still the best in the range of $0 - $40)

This will probably now be my keyboard at work.",The budget backlit,1412726400,

I am even having a hard time righting a review for this right now without pressing the keys completely in the middle.
Another con is the enter key. In typical keyboards the enter key is in rectangular shape, which is what most of the people are used to, however, this keyboard does not have that type of rectangular enter key. If you buy this keyboard, you will need a lot of patience to not rage.

I am on my computer probably 12 - 14 hours a day (I work from home), so I have a good feel of how this set works and find that it fits in great with my daily routines and activities.

The layout of the keyboard is not quite like a regular keyboard, though. Delete, Home, Page Up, Page Down, End and even the Arrow Keys are all in a weird spot. After a few days, I got the hang of it and it didn't take me a few minutes to find those keys (I use most of them pretty regularly). I love the feel of this keyboard. The keys are low and very soft - you can't hear a sound when you type. It's so smooth typing on it. I also love the adjustable feet on the back (I hate typing on a flat keyboard - I like to have it elevated).

The mouse is very basic but works well. There aren't any extra buttons or even horizontal scrolling - only left click, right click and middle click. It's very lightweight (as is the keyboard) and wouldn't be a pain to take on-the-go with you. There's no delay or anything when using it.

I have no complaints about this set. It's easy to use, easy to setup and works really well. I was surprised that it worked right away as soon as I plugged it into my Ubuntu computer (not everything is always this flawless with Linux). Both the keyboard and mouse each use one AA battery.

The mouse is the most silent I've ever had - no clicking sound at all. The keyboard, on the other hand, has almost a retro click. Exactly the opposite of what I had with HP. Feels odd, but it may be just a matter of getting used to it.
The one definite fault I can find is the square-ish font they chose to label the key. It is really hard to read. Don't get me wrong, you'll know what the keys are, but it's a font that does not register as quickly in the brain as others considered very readable. I feel like I make an effort reading it. Not a good idea when you're supposed just to glance at the keys once in a while.
It also feels a little crowded. Probably because they managed to add the arrow keys and still keep the same size as my old HP keyboard. It's a tradeoff. I don't like crowded, but I do like my arrow keys...",Looks better in pictures,1495238400,

The keyboard's key strokes are pretty quiet, but some of the keys are _just_ loose enough to rattle a little as you take your fingers away. Again, nothing too bad, especially for the price.

The mouse is by far the worst mouse I have ever used.  The optical sensor doesn't work well so the speed and direction of my cursor is NEVER consistent.

Also, I'm a computer tech and I purchase 90% of my supplies for my clients online. I saw this keyboard and decided to give it a try. The first keyboard that came in from Jelly Comb had a problem either with the receiver or the keyboard itself and often times would miss the first two letters when I started blasting away. Jelly Comb support responded to my request for help the very same day, They had me run a couple of tests which didn't solve the problem so they immediately sent me a replacement. During the process they were very courteous and apologetic as well.
Since I purchase so much tech gear online I know that the quality of a product is not only the product itself but the company that is supposed to stand behind it. Jelly Comb easily passes both tests as far as I'm concerned. This is the best keyboard and mouse I've ever used and the company backs it up 110%.

Looks fantastic
Mouse works very well

Cons
Keyboard is not very responsive.  I've had many issues where I typed a key and it did not register for some reason
Keyboard layout is confusing - Non-letter Keys are not in the ""normal"" order, which makes finding keys a little difficult.
No space between the arrow keys and the non-letter keys -- the ""end"" key and the arrow keys are right next to each other.  I've hit end a few times instead of the left arrow key.  I've also hit ""end"" instead of enter a few times as well.

If the last two issues were fixed, I would be thrilled with the purchase (even though sometimes the system doesn't register a key stroke).  However, the last two are deal killers. I'm going to buy a different keyboard/mouse combo.",Just OK,1480896000,

Weaver,"I got this combo to use on an Android Astro Tab A10 tablet I bought not long ago. I have large fingers and that tends to cause me a bit of trouble on smaller touch screens. This looked like just what I needed to solve this problem. I got it in today and proceeded to see what I had. First thing I noted was the keyboard was just the size I needed and so was the mouse. The keyboard's key feel is nice and quiet, yet very easy to use. I noted that the keyboard battery contacts were just a bit loose in that the spring wasn't pushing the battery forward enough to make really good contact with the forward terminal. (This was fixed by stretching the back spring a bit.) Beside that small problem, I encountered no other problem with the battery installation. After I got the batteries installed I plugged the USB receiver into the A10's standard USB port and both the mouse and the keyboard worked great. The only other problems I ran into were very minor with the first on really due to the design to save battery power. When the KB and mouse ""go to sleep"" it can sometimes be hard to wake up the mouse by moving it. I found that a sort of rapid jiggling motion or tapping on the KB space bar rapidly seems to work best. The only other thing I ran into was the that mouse had a tendency to get a bit jerky if the A10 was in landscape view and an app opened that forced it to go to portrait instead. It doesn't become non-function but just gets a little jerky in it's movements. Other than that. this combo really fit my bill. It's very compact KB really works well with my tablet and the mouse does too. This is just what I needed.",Not A Bad Combo..,1480291200,

Setup was simple plug & play, easy. The transmitter in the mouse is either very weak, or the usb receiver is crap, or a combination of the two. Either way, the mouse was very laggy/choppy, and sometimes would refuse to go in the direction I was moving it. I figured it was just having difficulty with the surface of my desk. It is a very light color, so I went and bought a proper mouse pad, solid black, but alas, the issue persisted. Finally I moved the receiver to one of the usb ports on the front of my computer, and that did the trick. Currently, the receiver is about 4ft away, and in direct line of sight with the mouse. I guess that extra 18 inches and having to go through my monitor was just too much for it. One other complaint with the mouse is the click buttons. They require next to no force to click, and don't click. In fact, it offers nearly no feedback at all. I'm finding it difficult to get used to. Also worth mentioning is that the mouse is small and un-ergonomical. The keyboard lights don't have the labels printed on the keyboard, but were added after the fact with a cheap sticker, which doesn't even correctly label the lights. The low battery indicator is pointing to the num lock light. The num lock points to the nothing. Only the caps lock light shows up where it is supposed to be. I'm guessing the actual low battery indicator light will show up somewhere, in time. Also, the left hand shift key is only half the size that it should be. It has been made smaller to fit a retarded & useless(at least for me) function key. I have to say, this is my biggest complaint by far.

The space bar is a lot better sounding than most but the backspace key is the loudest of them all for some reason. The keyboard also has a tendency to short out every now and then and I have to restart my computer for it to start working again. I do still like it despite those flaws.

I wouldn't say that this keyboard is quiet. It has a really nice press and sounds much like that of an older mac keyboard (not the new ones where the key travel-distances are short). There are just certain days when I want that wholesome-key feel, versus the short taps (which then I whip out my Logitech Solar Keyboard). The keyboard is light enough that if you wanted to use it as a portable solution, you could (though I will be keeping this on my home desktop). I even like the font that they used for the lettering, a nice tech-oriented font. It takes a bit of time to get used to the fact that the arrow keys are embedded without any spacing, between the QWERTY and the Number Pad, but its not too troubling. It also means that you get a more compact keyboard and don't have to reach that far for your mouse. The only thing I do find a bit strange is that the F4 (Volume -) and F5 (Volume +) are reversed. On almost all keyboards that allow this function, it is sorted so that F5 is Volume +. Just a thought. Not a big deal but often I find myself turning it down rather than turning it up (or vice versa). I don't use the mouse, as I have a Kensington blade that I am married to, but it did have some delay with tracking on my clear desk mat, when I tried it a few times. I fiddled around with the settings and the problem still seemed to occur. Like I said, not a big deal to me since I'm not using it, but it might be if you are buying this for the entire set. The click is definitely quiet. It's just not a good mouse and I would personally recommend buying another mouse alongside it, if you don't have one.

Overall, I would recommend this set for the keyboard -- if you are looking for that feel of an older mac keyboard (this really is the quality that stood out for me). I wasn't looking for that when I purchased (I wanted something sleek and had some deeper keys), but it's become my favorite feature.",Great Quality Compact Keyboard.,1474761600,

If you were to want to use it for a tablet or smart phone, you would need a USB OTG cable.  Both the keyboard and mouse have a good weight and feel to them and are very quiet.  When the Odroid system boots, they connect immediately after clicking once with the mouse. The keyboard is compact, in that it does not have the excessive plastic around it that most full size keyboards have, but it also does not feel cramped when typing, and is quite comfortable to use.  There is some airspace between the keys and the keyboard itself, which will make it easy to use compressed air for cleaning purposes if any dust or debris fall into it.

If you touch type this is not your board combo. Skipped and double characters are the norm. serious typing is impossible. I missed the return window so I threw the keyboard away. I did keep the mouse.

Cons: Keyboard
No tactile (haptic) response just like most others in the price range.
Key switches are of an inconsistent quality. Tap one lightly and you may get double characters, another has to be pounded.  Double characters and lost spaces are the norm. Hence the low star count.  The keys float at high speeds or skip if you have a light touch.
LEDs are hidden from view under the delete key and make me wonder why they are there.  Most boards in this price range do not have them at all.

Cons: Mouse
Patterned, wood and dark surfaces that work well with Microsoft and Logitech do not work with this mouse.
Scroll is anything but smooth.  Slow scroll barely moves, fast scroll pages at a time.  I am constantly losing my place and use keyboard navigation instead. To be fair I am aging and getting slower.

Overall:
Jelly Comb exhibited an outstanding response to my original low star review.  They were genuinely concerned about their brand and my business.  I will try their other products.
I would buy this board again for Web TV or games or any use where a rugged, durable keyboard is necessary and where the keyboard only receives light typing.

The keyboard that came wth my new Asus Zen did not provide much feedback when typing, and the mouse was very ordinary.  I bought this keyboard/mouse combo as an upgrade and I am so glad I did!

PROS: The keyboard does not have a very definitive ""click"" when you type, but the keys have a lot of travel -- which for me makes it a lot easier to type fast and know you're hitting the right keys.  It just has a really good feel to it, though you do have to press the keys all the way down in order to get them to register.  I would prefer if it didn't require so much pressure on every key.  It could get tiring after a lot of typing.
I also love the way it looks, for whatever that's worth.
And despite having all of the keys including arrows etc., it's extremely compact -- taking up a minimal amount of real estate on my desk.  A huge plus!  All the benefits of a full-size keyboard (except for a separate numeric keypad) and yet very compact.
The mouse is very responsive -- I did not see any lag or any problems at all.  The mouse clicks nicely and the scroll wheel works fine.
CONS: The only thing I didn't like about this setup was that the mouse wheel was too tight.  With light pressure on the wheel, the rubber part slides but doesn't activate the mechanism -- so you have to kind of put pressure on the wheel to get it to turn.  I didn't like this at all.  But I took the mouse apart -- just one screw -- and with a jewler's screwdriver I very carefully pressed the metal detent that clicks when you turn the wheel, and now it takes much less pressure to spin the wheel and yet you still feel the clicks.","Just a couple of minor gripes, but overall I love it.",1460419200,

I tried the HP Wireless Elite Keyboard v2., but the space bar was noisy compared to the rest of the keys. The Jelly keyboard isn't perfect, but it's very good. Moreover, the mouse is incredibly quiet, better in my opinion than the shhhhmouse that I also tried. I originally declined to buy the Jelly package because it seemed to be too cheap to outclass the competition including the Anker CB310 Full-Size Ergonomic Wireless Keyboard and Mouse, which I also tried and didn't have a quiet mouse to match the keyboard.

Though some buyers complain about the compact size - it does take a bit of practice to get used to - I like this feature as I can easily through it into my backpack and haul it with me.

I purchased it as I dumped my old Windows Desktop TV and replaced it with a ChromeBox the size of a paperback book. The ChromeBox did come with a workable Bluetooth Keyboard and Mouse, but I really wanted a more standard keyboard with rear legs to give it a forward tilt. This keyboard is big enough for more extensive keyboard entry, and it does have a separate numeric keypad. The mouse and keyboard are both cordless and are comfortable to work with.

The action is good-but-not-great, but I still give this 5 stars because the value is excellent and unless you really rely on lots of extra keys beyond the normal function keys this keyboard does have, It's fully functional.

After years of cables and ""Tower CPUs"" that I banged my shins on, and the hard drives that crashed, this keyboard and mouse mean that the only two cables I'm no connected to are the power supply to the Chrome Box and the cable between a USB 2.0 port and my 21"" Dell 1080 dpi monitor (I found a great deal on a cable with a USB connector to use my old screen on the amazingly small Chrome Box, and am relying on Cloud Storage instead of onboard memory.
