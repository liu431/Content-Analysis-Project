Research problem: New innovations in natural language processing (such as BERT) have enabled researchers to summarize the Amazon reviews text efficiently. However, reviews are not created equal as they have different impact on consumers' purchase decision. Thus, we hypothesize that the summaries would be more helpful if the algorithm trains the reviews with different weights. Using ensemble feature selection methods, we find the features that are most helpful for consumers and calculate the weights for the reviews. Then we train the text generation/summarization algorithm to create new summaries. To measure the improvement, we run experiments and let the coders to score the summarizes in terms of helpfulness.
